ðŸ”¥ TL;DR: We show that scaling up thinking tokens of English-centric reasoning language models such as s1 can improve multilingual math reasoning performance. In addition, we analyze language-mixing patterns, performance of different reasoning languages through language forcing, and multilingual cross-domain generalization.
