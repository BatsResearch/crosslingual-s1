Each subsequent glass costs 60% of the previous glass's price. Let's calculate the cost for the first few glasses to identify the pattern:\n\n1. The first glass costs 5 US dollars.\n2. The second glass costs 60% of 5 US dollars, which is \\( 0.60 \\times 5 = 3 \\) US dollars.\n3. The third glass costs 60% of 3 US dollars, which is \\( 0.60 \\times 3 = 1.80 \\) US dollars.\n\nWe can see that the cost of each glass forms a geometric sequence where the first term \\( a = 5 \\) and the common ratio \\( r = 0.60 \\).\n\nThe cost of the \\( n \\)-th glass can be calculated using the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of a geometric sequence:\n\\[ a_n = a \\times r^{(n-1)} \\]\n\nFor the 16th glass:\n\\[ a_{16} = 5 \\times (0.60)^{15} \\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( (0.60)^{15} \\):\n\\[ (0.60)^{15} \\approx 0.004701897637795212 \\]\n\nNow, multiply this by 5:\n\\[ a_{16} \\approx 5 \\times 0.004701897637795212 \\approx 0.02350948818897606 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of the 16th glass is approximately 0.0235 US dollars.\n\nTo find the total cost for 16 glasses, we sum the costs of each glass from the first to the 16th:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 5 + 3 + 1.80 + 0.0235 + \\ldots + 0.0235 \\]\n\nThis is the sum of a geometric series with the first term \\( a = 5 \\), common ratio \\( r = 0.60 \\), and 16 terms. The sum \\( S_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series is given by:\n\\[ S_n = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ S_{16} = 5 \\frac{1 - (0.60)^{16}}{1 - 0.60} \\]\n\\[ S_{16} = 5 \\frac{1 - (0.60)^{16}}{0.40} \\]\n\\[ S_{16} = 12.5 \\left(1 - (0.60)^{16}\\right) \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (0.60)^{16} \\):\n\\[ (0.60)^{16} \\approx 0.00043046721 \\]\n\nSo:\n\\[ S_{16} = 12.5 \\left(1 - 0.00043046721\\right) \\]\n\\[ S_{16} = 12.5 \\times 0.99956953279 \\]\n\\[ S_{16} \\approx 12.4946 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is approximately 12.49 US dollars.

Wenn ursprünglich 30 Autos auf der Autobahn standen, wie viele Autos sind dann in den ersten 15 Minuten durch den Stau gefahren?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial number of cars on the highway:** 30 cars.\n\n2. **Cars that arrive in the first 15 minutes:** Let's denote this number as \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Cars that arrive in the next 15 minutes:** 20 cars.\n\n4. **Cars that leave the highway:** 5 cars.\n\nThe total number of cars on the highway after these events can be calculated by considering the initial number of cars plus the cars that arrived and subtracting the cars that left.\n\nThe equation representing the total number of cars on the highway after the events is:\n\\[ 30 + x + 20 - 5 \\]\n\nWe know that after all these events, the total number of cars on the highway is still 30 (since the problem doesn't specify any other cars arriving or leaving after the first 30 minutes). Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 30 + x + 20 - 5 = 30 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[ 45 + x - 5 = 30 \\]\n\\[ 40 + x = 30 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 30 - 40 \\]\n\\[ x = -10 \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) cannot be negative, it indicates that the initial number of cars that arrived in the first 15 minutes must be adjusted to fit the total number of cars remaining on the highway. Given the constraints, let's re-evaluate the problem:\n\nIf we assume the total number of cars on the highway remains 30, and considering the cars that left (5), the cars that arrived in the first 15 minutes (\\( x \\)) and the cars that arrived in the next 15 minutes (20) must sum up to the initial number of cars plus the cars that left:\n\n\\[ 30 + x + 20 - 5 = 30 \\]\n\\[ 45 + x - 5 = 30 \\]\n\\[ 40 + x = 30 \\]\n\\[ x = 30 - 40 \\]\n\\[ x = -10 \\]\n\nThis negative value indicates an inconsistency. Given the problem constraints, let's assume the total number of cars on the highway remains 30, and the cars that left (5) must be subtracted from the initial number of cars plus the cars that arrived:\n\n\\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \\]\n\nThus, the number of cars that arrived in the first 15 minutes (\\( x \\)) plus the cars that arrived in the next 15 minutes (20) must sum up to 25:\n\n\\[ x + 20 = 25 \\]\n\\[ x = 25 - 20 \\]\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cars that arrived in the first 15 minutes is 5.

Vor 4 Minuten hatte der große Swimmingpool doppelt so viel Wasser wie der kleine Swimmingpool. Jetzt hat der große Swimmingpool vier Mal so viel Wasser wie der kleine Swimmingpool. Wie viel Wasser hat der kleine Swimmingpool jetzt?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Let's denote the current amount of water in the small swimming pool as \\( x \\) gallons. According to the problem, the large swimming pool currently has four times as much water as the small swimming pool, so the large swimming pool has \\( 4x \\) gallons of water.\n\nBefore the 4 minutes that have passed, the large swimming pool had double the amount of water in the small swimming pool. So, before the 4 minutes, the large swimming pool had \\( 2x \\) gallons of water, and the small swimming pool had \\( x \\) gallons of water.\n\nSince both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool would have lost \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) gallons of water.\n\nTherefore, before the 4 minutes, the large swimming pool had \\( 2x - 16 \\) gallons of water, and the small swimming pool had \\( x - 16 \\) gallons of water.\n\nGiven that after the 4 minutes, the large swimming pool has \\( 4x \\) gallons and the small swimming pool has \\( x \\) gallons, we can set up the following equations based on the water levels before and after the 4 minutes:\n\n1. \\( 2x - 16 = 4x - 16 \\) (before the 4 minutes, the large pool had double the small pool)\n2. \\( x - 16 = x \\) (after the 4 minutes, the large pool has four times the small pool)\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that:\n\\[ x - 16 = x \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ -16 = 0 \\]\nThis equation is not possible, which indicates that the initial condition given (the large pool having double the small pool before the 4 minutes) is not consistent with the final condition (the large pool having four times the small pool after the 4 minutes).\n\nHowever, we can use the first equation to find the value of \\( x \\):\n\\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 16 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 2x = 4x \\]\n\\[ 0 = 2x \\]\n\\[ x = 0 \\]\n\nThis result is not practical for a swimming pool, so let's re-evaluate the problem with the given conditions. Since the large pool has four times the small pool after 4 minutes, and both pools are losing water at the same rate, we can directly use the final condition to find \\( x \\).\n\nGiven that the large pool has \\( 4x \\) gallons and the small pool has \\( x \\) gallons after 4 minutes, and knowing the total water loss is 16 gallons per pool, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 4x - 16 = 4 \\times x \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 4x - 16 = 4x \\]\n\\[ -16 = 0 \\]\nThis is not possible, so we need to use the initial condition directly.\n\nSince the large pool has four times the small pool after 4 minutes, and the small pool loses 16 gallons, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 4x = 4(x - 16) \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 4x = 4x - 64 \\]\n\\[ 0 = -64 \\]\nThis is not possible, so we need to use the initial condition directly.\n\nGiven the problem constraints, the small pool must have \\( x = 16 \\) gallons to satisfy the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the small swimming pool now has \\(\\boxed{16}\\) gallons of water."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "b1f665c20d352f7c031572547ff35d3ecc1eb86eb3f14c560001a08d9a2b7732", "prompt_hash": "c9643a3ba01dfe97e832b14c8b0d7f6bc923a30fee76b3d6578aeeb6d65d030d", "target_hash": "2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3", "exact_match": 0.0}

The third glass costs 60% of 3 US dollars, which is \\( 0.60 \\times 3 = 1.80 \\) US dollars.\n\nWe can see that the cost of each glass forms a geometric sequence where the first term \\( a = 5 \\) and the common ratio \\( r = 0.60 \\).\n\nThe cost of the \\( n \\)-th glass can be calculated using the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of a geometric sequence:\n\\[ a_n = a \\times r^{(n-1)} \\]\n\nFor the 16th glass:\n\\[ a_{16} = 5 \\times (0.60)^{15} \\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( (0.60)^{15} \\):\n\\[ (0.60)^{15} \\approx 0.004701897637795212 \\]\n\nNow, multiply this by 5:\n\\[ a_{16} \\approx 5 \\times 0.004701897637795212 \\approx 0.02350948818897606 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of the 16th glass is approximately 0.0235 US dollars.\n\nTo find the total cost for 16 glasses, we sum the costs of each glass from the first to the 16th:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 5 + 3 + 1.80 + 0.0235 + \\ldots + 0.0235 \\]\n\nThis is the sum of a geometric series with the first term \\( a = 5 \\), common ratio \\( r = 0.60 \\), and 16 terms. The sum \\( S_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series is given by:\n\\[ S_n = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ S_{16} = 5 \\frac{1 - (0.60)^{16}}{1 - 0.60} \\]\n\\[ S_{16} = 5 \\frac{1 - (0.60)^{16}}{0.40} \\]\n\\[ S_{16} = 12.5 \\left(1 - (0.60)^{16}\\right) \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (0.60)^{16} \\):\n\\[ (0.60)^{16} \\approx 0.00043046721 \\]\n\nSo:\n\\[ S_{16} = 12.5 \\left(1 - 0.00043046721\\right) \\]\n\\[ S_{16} = 12.5 \\times 0.99956953279 \\]\n\\[ S_{16} \\approx 12.4946 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is approximately 12.49 US dollars.

The total weight of these \\( x \\) playthings is:\n\\[ x \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{x}{2} \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nAfter removing these \\( x \\) playthings, the weight of the remaining items in the bag should be 7.5 pounds. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\\[ 7.5 = 7.5 - \\frac{x}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ 7.5 - \\frac{x}{2} = 7.5 \\]\n\\[ -\\frac{x}{2} = 0 \\]\n\\[ x = 0 \\]\n\nSo, Uriah does not need to remove any more playthings.

Let's recheck the problem statement and calculations.\n\nGiven the total profit and the selling price per set, let's assume the Händler sold the sacks in sets of 20 and calculated the profit correctly.\n\nIf the Händler sold all the sacks in sets of 20 and made a profit of $400, we can directly calculate the number of sets sold:\n\n6. **Number of Sets Sold:**\n   - Let \\( y \\) be the number of sets sold.\n   - The total selling price for \\( y \\) sets is \\( 600y \\) dollars.\n   - The total cost for \\( y \\) sets is \\( 60y \\) dollars.\n   - The profit is given as $400:\n     \\[\n     600y - 60y = 400\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the equation:\n     \\[\n     540y = 400\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( y \\):\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{400}{540} = \\frac{20}{27}\n     \\]\n\nSince \\( y \\) must be a whole number, let's recheck the problem constraints. If the Händler sold the sacks in sets of 20 and made a profit of $400, the number of sets sold must be a whole number. Given the constraints, the Händler must have sold 1 set of 20 sacks to make a profit of $400.\n\nTherefore, the number of sacks sold is:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ set} \\times 20 \\text{ sacks/set} = 20 \\text{ sacks}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["20"], "doc_hash": "5f7cef292bad7c0be5c0df618cfb243e28e3bf6c9a5f09b086adb05ed2999078", "prompt_hash": "fc4092e4de141c32244f55539608937cf04694b85f9ddb9bceaa4af8bd4f16f9", "target_hash": "1a6562590ef19d1045d06c4055742d38288e9e6dcd71ccde5cee80f1d5a774eb", "exact_match": 0.0}

So, before the 4 minutes, the large swimming pool had \\( 2x \\) gallons of water, and the small swimming pool had \\( x \\) gallons of water.\n\nSince both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool would have lost \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) gallons of water.\n\nTherefore, before the 4 minutes, the large swimming pool had \\( 2x - 16 \\) gallons of water, and the small swimming pool had \\( x - 16 \\) gallons of water.\n\nGiven that after the 4 minutes, the large swimming pool has \\( 4x \\) gallons and the small swimming pool has \\( x \\) gallons, we can set up the following equations based on the water levels before and after the 4 minutes:\n\n1. \\( 2x - 16 = 4x - 16 \\) (before the 4 minutes, the large pool had double the small pool)\n2. \\( x - 16 = x \\) (after the 4 minutes, the large pool has four times the small pool)\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that:\n\\[ x - 16 = x \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ -16 = 0 \\]\nThis equation is not possible, which indicates that the initial condition given (the large pool having double the small pool before the 4 minutes) is not consistent with the final condition (the large pool having four times the small pool after the 4 minutes).\n\nHowever, we can use the first equation to find the value of \\( x \\):\n\\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 16 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 2x = 4x \\]\n\\[ 0 = 2x \\]\n\\[ x = 0 \\]\n\nThis result is not practical for a swimming pool, so let's re-evaluate the problem with the given conditions. Since the large pool has four times the small pool after 4 minutes, and both pools are losing water at the same rate, we can directly use the final condition to find \\( x \\).\n\nGiven that the large pool has \\( 4x \\) gallons and the small pool has \\( x \\) gallons after 4 minutes, and knowing the total water loss is 16 gallons per pool, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 4x - 16 = 4 \\times x \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 4x - 16 = 4x \\]\n\\[ -16 = 0 \\]\nThis is not possible, so we need to use the initial condition directly.\n\nSince the large pool has four times the small pool after 4 minutes, and the small pool loses 16 gallons, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 4x = 4(x - 16) \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 4x = 4x - 64 \\]\n\\[ 0 = -64 \\]\nThis is not possible, so we need to use the initial condition directly.\n\nGiven the problem constraints, the small pool must have \\( x = 16 \\) gallons to satisfy the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the small swimming pool now has \\(\\boxed{16}\\) gallons of water."]], "filtered_resps": ["16"], "doc_hash": "b1f665c20d352f7c031572547ff35d3ecc1eb86eb3f14c560001a08d9a2b7732", "prompt_hash": "c9643a3ba01dfe97e832b14c8b0d7f6bc923a30fee76b3d6578aeeb6d65d030d", "target_hash": "2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3", "exact_match": 0.0}
