Since she has 20 poulets and they are fed in three separate meals, we need to determine how many bowls of food are given for the last meal.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of bowls given in the morning and afternoon:\n- Morning: 15 bowls\n- Afternoon: 25 bowls\n\nAdding these together:\n15 + 25 = 40 bowls\n\nHowever, Wendi only has 30 bowls of food for the day.

This suggests that the problem might have a mistake in the given numbers, as it's not possible to give 40 bowls when only 30 are available.\n\nAssuming the problem meant to say that Wendi has 30 bowls and she has already given 40 bowls (which is not possible), we can infer that the last meal must have been given fewer bowls than initially calculated. Given the constraints, the only logical conclusion is that the last meal must have been given the remaining bowls to make up the total of 30 bowls.\n\nSince the total bowls given in the morning and afternoon is 40, and only 30 are available, the last meal must have been given the remaining bowls:\n\n30 (total bowls) - 30 (morning and afternoon bowls) = 0 bowls\n\nTherefore, Wendi must have given 0 bowls of food for the last meal.

To find out how long she needs to spend on the remaining 6 miles to achieve this average speed, we use the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\]\n\nGiven that her average speed should be 4 miles per hour and the remaining distance is 6 miles, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the total time:\n\n\\[ 4 = \\frac{6}{\\text{Total Time}} \\]\n\nSolving for Total Time:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Time} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince she has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles), the additional time she needs to spend on the remaining 6 miles is:\n\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ hours} - 2 \\text{ hours} = -0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it indicates that she has already exceeded the required time to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trip. Therefore, she does not need to increase her speed for the remaining distance to meet her goal of an average speed of 4 miles per hour.\n\nThe answer is that Marissa does not need to increase her speed for the remaining distance.

According to the problem, the number of times the team has won is \\( L \\) plus some additional number of times, which we can denote as \\( W \\). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of matches played as:\n\n\\[ W + L = 22 \\]\n\nWe are also given that the number of wins is \\( L \\) plus some additional number of wins, so we can express the number of wins as:\n\n\\[ W = L + x \\]\n\nWhere \\( x \\) is the additional number of wins. Substituting \\( W = L + x \\) into the first equation, we get:\n\n\\[ L + x + L = 22 \\]\n\\[ 2L + x = 22 \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) represents an additional number of wins, it must be a non-negative integer.

Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so he watched \\(0.5x\\) hours on Wednesday.\n- **Jeudi (Thursday):** Frankie watched 1 episode of 1 hour and 1 episode of 30 minutes. So, he watched \\(1 \\text{ hour} + 0.5 \\text{ hour} = 1.5 \\text{ hours}\\) on Thursday.\n- **Vendredi (Friday):** Frankie watched 2 episodes of 1 hour each. So, he watched \\(1 \\text{ hour} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 2 \\text{ hours}\\) on Friday.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total time spent watching TV over the week:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \\text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \\text{ hours (Thursday)} + 2 \\text{ hours (Friday)} = 7 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nCombine the known hours:\n\\[ 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSubtract this from the total time to find the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday:\n\\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing the remaining time by 0.5:\n\\[ \\frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday.

Les rats sont répartis dans 3 cages par groupes de taille égale et chaque rat reçoit 6 morceaux de paille. Il y a 10 cages de hamsters. Chacun d'eux est seul dans sa cage et reçoit 5 morceaux de paille. Il y a aussi un enclos de lapins où l'on distribue 20 morceaux de paille. Aucune paille n'est utilisée ailleurs dans le magasin. Si 160 morceaux de paille ont été distribués aux petits rongeurs, combien de rats y a-t-il dans chaque cage ?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["First, let's calculate the total number of paille pieces distributed to the hamsters and the lapins.\n\nFor the hamsters:\n- There are 10 cages.\n- Each cage has one hamster.\n- Each hamster receives 5 pieces of paille.\nSo, the total number of paille pieces for the hamsters is 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.\n\nFor the lapins:\n- There is 1 enclosure.\n- The enclosure receives 20 pieces of paille.\nSo, the total number of paille pieces for the lapins is 20 pieces.\n\nNow, let's add the paille pieces used for the hamsters and the lapins:\n50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (lapins) = 70 pieces.\n\nWe know that a total of 160 pieces of paille were distributed to the small rodents. Therefore, the number of paille pieces used for the rats is:\n160 pieces (total) - 70 pieces (hamsters and lapins) = 90 pieces.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many rats there are. Since each rat receives 6 pieces of paille, we can find the number of rats by dividing the total paille pieces for the rats by the number of pieces each rat receives:\n90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many rats are in each cage. There are 3 cages, and there are 15 rats in total:\n15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.\n\nSo, there are 5 rats in each cage."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "5360844da21ee84d14d77fc025dcec56938ce40048d8bca1c8921d2dd0b0c6fd", "prompt_hash": "75aa7caf40e159ae92b6a60459a24b9b011270fe13dcd5031f88912c38e3b5f2", "target_hash": "ef2d127de37b942baad06145e54b0c619a1f22327b2ebbcfbec78f5564afe39d", "exact_match": 0.0}

Since she has 20 poulets and they are fed in three separate meals, we need to determine how many bowls of food are given for the last meal.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of bowls given in the morning and afternoon:\n- Morning: 15 bowls\n- Afternoon: 25 bowls\n\nAdding these together:\n15 + 25 = 40 bowls\n\nHowever, Wendi only has 30 bowls of food for the day.

To find out how many bowls are left for the last meal, we subtract the bowls given in the morning and afternoon from the total bowls available:\n\n30 (total bowls) - 40 (morning and afternoon bowls) = -10\n\nSince we get a negative number, it indicates that the total bowls given (40) exceed the total available (30). This suggests that the problem might have a mistake in the given numbers, as it's not possible to give 40 bowls when only 30 are available.\n\nAssuming the problem meant to say that Wendi has 30 bowls and she has already given 40 bowls (which is not possible), we can infer that the last meal must have been given fewer bowls than initially calculated. Given the constraints, the only logical conclusion is that the last meal must have been given the remaining bowls to make up the total of 30 bowls.\n\nSince the total bowls given in the morning and afternoon is 40, and only 30 are available, the last meal must have been given the remaining bowls:\n\n30 (total bowls) - 30 (morning and afternoon bowls) = 0 bowls\n\nTherefore, Wendi must have given 0 bowls of food for the last meal.

L'une des deux équipes est très bien rodée et chacun de ses membres fait ses 400 mètres en 55 secondes exactement. L'autre équipe est moins bien rodée. Son premier coureur fait 400 mètres en 60 secondes, puis chaque coureur suivant est 3 secondes plus rapide que le précédent.
