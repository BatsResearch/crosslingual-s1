There are 4 teachers who share the whiteboards.\n2. Each teacher has 2 classes per day.\n3.

So, we can find the total number of classes per day:\n- Since there are 8 uses per day and each class uses the whiteboard 3 times, the total number of classes per day is \\( \\frac{8 \\text{ uses per day}}{3 \\text{ uses per class}} = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.67 \\text{ classes per day} \\).\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a class, we need to consider the practical scenario where the whiteboard is used for full classes. Given that 8 uses per day are spread over 2.67 classes, it implies that the whiteboard is used for 2 full classes and part of a third class.\n\nFinally, since the whiteboard is used 3 times per class, the total number of times the whiteboard is used per day is 8.\n\nTherefore, the whiteboard is used 8 times per day.\n\nSo, the whiteboard is cleaned 8 times per day.\n\nThe answer is: \\(\\boxed{8}\\)"]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "1ab73dfcb60856ca0319de98411f91ab658b38c131fc1b4a7d0d517eae84fa80", "prompt_hash": "f9f3ea9cb9f9c34ef39d6e001584dbf04632455baf5c949bca0d0179637a083b", "target_hash": "c2356069e9d1e79ca924378153cfbbfb4d4416b1f99d41a2940bfdb66c5319db", "exact_match": 0.0}

Let's denote the number of queen bees as \\( Q \\).\n2. According to the problem, the number of worker bees is twice the number of queen bees. So, the number of worker bees \\( W \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   W = 2Q\n   \\]\n3. The problem also states that the number of worker bees is 12 times the number of baby bees. Let's denote the number of baby bees as \\( B \\). So, we have:\n   \\[\n   W = 12B\n   \\]\n4. Since the number of worker bees is twice the number of queen bees, we can substitute \\( W \\) in the second equation:\n   \\[\n   2Q = 12B\n   \\]\n5. Solving for \\( B \\) in terms of \\( Q \\):\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{2Q}{12} = \\frac{Q}{6}\n   \\]\n6. Now, we know the total number of bees in the hive is 700. This total includes queen bees, worker bees, and baby bees. Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   Q + W + B = 700\n   \\]\n7. Substituting \\( W = 2Q \\) and \\( B = \\frac{Q}{6} \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   Q + 2Q + \\frac{Q}{6} = 700\n   \\]\n8. Combining like terms:\n   \\[\n   3Q + \\frac{Q}{6} = 700\n   \\]\n9. To combine the terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 6 is 6:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18Q}{6} + \\frac{Q}{6} = 700\n   \\]\n10. Adding the fractions:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{19Q}{6} = 700\n    \\]\n11. Solving for \\( Q \\) by multiplying both sides by 6:\n    \\[\n    19Q = 4200\n    \\]\n12. Dividing both sides by 19:\n    \\[\n    Q = \\frac{4200}{19} \\approx 221.05\n    \\]\nSince the number of bees must be a whole number, we need to check if 221 is a reasonable approximation. Given the context, we can round to the nearest whole number, which is 221.\n\n13. Now, we calculate the number of worker bees \\( W \\):\n    \\[\n    W = 2Q = 2 \\times 221 = 442\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of worker bees is \\(\\boxed{442}\\)."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "397d5c674370ed0e411ad86a364d668b9dd2f5ba29f48053dd48f32f1d296f56", "prompt_hash": "666acf0f23a59ad523193e7cacc9e06c11c89240698816a913a2b20366dac356", "target_hash": "26d228663f13a88592a12d16cf9587caab0388b262d6d9f126ed62f9333aca94", "exact_match": 0.0}

This means they must have sold more than 1 gallon to achieve this profit.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Gallons Sold:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of gallons sold.\n   - The total revenue from selling \\( x \\) gallons is \\( 10x \\) dollars.\n   - The total cost for \\( x \\) gallons is \\( 13x \\) dollars.\n   - The profit is given by \\( 10x - 13x = -3x \\) dollars.\n   - We know the profit is 25 dollars, so \\( -3x = 25 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( x \\), we get \\( x = -\\frac{25}{3} \\), which is not possible since \\( x \\) must be a positive number.\n\nGiven the above, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct approach:\n\n- They sell 20 cups per gallon at $0.50 per cup, so the revenue per gallon is $10.\n- The cost per gallon is $13.\n- The profit per gallon is $10 - $13 = -$3, which indicates a loss per gallon.\n\nSince the profit is positive at $25, we need to find how many gallons they need to sell to achieve this profit. Let \\( y \\) be the number of gallons sold.\n\n\\[ 10y - 13y = 25 \\]\n\\[ -3y = 25 \\]\n\\[ y = -\\frac{25}{3} \\]\n\nThis indicates an error in the problem setup or interpretation.

However, typically in such problems, we assume the exact calculation without rounding, so we'll use 22.5 for the calculation.\n\nNow, let's determine how many hand-written letters were in the block when Jenny started her work:\n- Letters that need stamps = 22.5\n- Letters already stamped = 30\n- Total letters in the block = Letters that need stamps + Letters already stamped\n- Total letters in the block = 22.5 + 30 = 52.5\n\nSince the number of letters must be a whole number, and typically such problems assume whole numbers, we can conclude that the block initially had 52 or 53 letters.

Let's denote the number of queen bees as \\( Q \\).\n2. According to the problem, the number of worker bees is twice the number of queen bees. So, the number of worker bees \\( W \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   W = 2Q\n   \\]\n3. The problem also states that the number of worker bees is 12 times the number of baby bees. Let's denote the number of baby bees as \\( B \\). So, we have:\n   \\[\n   W = 12B\n   \\]\n4. Since the number of worker bees is twice the number of queen bees, we can substitute \\( W \\) in the second equation:\n   \\[\n   2Q = 12B\n   \\]\n5. Solving for \\( B \\) in terms of \\( Q \\):\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{2Q}{12} = \\frac{Q}{6}\n   \\]\n6. Now, we know the total number of bees in the hive is 700. This total includes queen bees, worker bees, and baby bees. Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   Q + W + B = 700\n   \\]\n7. Substituting \\( W = 2Q \\) and \\( B = \\frac{Q}{6} \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   Q + 2Q + \\frac{Q}{6} = 700\n   \\]\n8. Combining like terms:\n   \\[\n   3Q + \\frac{Q}{6} = 700\n   \\]\n9. To combine the terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 6 is 6:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18Q}{6} + \\frac{Q}{6} = 700\n   \\]\n10. Adding the fractions:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{19Q}{6} = 700\n    \\]\n11. Solving for \\( Q \\) by multiplying both sides by 6:\n    \\[\n    19Q = 4200\n    \\]\n12. Dividing both sides by 19:\n    \\[\n    Q = \\frac{4200}{19} \\approx 221.05\n    \\]\nSince the number of bees must be a whole number, we need to check if 221 is a reasonable approximation. Given the context, we can round to the nearest whole number, which is 221.\n\n13. Now, we calculate the number of worker bees \\( W \\):\n    \\[\n    W = 2Q = 2 \\times 221 = 442\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of worker bees is \\(\\boxed{442}\\)."]], "filtered_resps": ["442"], "doc_hash": "397d5c674370ed0e411ad86a364d668b9dd2f5ba29f48053dd48f32f1d296f56", "prompt_hash": "666acf0f23a59ad523193e7cacc9e06c11c89240698816a913a2b20366dac356", "target_hash": "26d228663f13a88592a12d16cf9587caab0388b262d6d9f126ed62f9333aca94", "exact_match": 0.0}

This means they must have sold more than 1 gallon to achieve this profit.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Gallons Sold:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of gallons sold.\n   - The total revenue from selling \\( x \\) gallons is \\( 10x \\) dollars.\n   - The total cost for \\( x \\) gallons is \\( 13x \\) dollars.\n   - The profit is given by \\( 10x - 13x = -3x \\) dollars.\n   - We know the profit is 25 dollars, so \\( -3x = 25 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( x \\), we get \\( x = -\\frac{25}{3} \\), which is not possible since \\( x \\) must be a positive number.\n\nGiven the above, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct approach:\n\n- They sell 20 cups per gallon at $0.50 per cup, so the revenue per gallon is $10.\n- The cost per gallon is $13.\n- The profit per gallon is $10 - $13 = -$3, which indicates a loss per gallon.\n\nSince the profit is positive at $25, we need to find how many gallons they need to sell to achieve this profit. Let \\( y \\) be the number of gallons sold.\n\n\\[ 10y - 13y = 25 \\]\n\\[ -3y = 25 \\]\n\\[ y = -\\frac{25}{3} \\]\n\nThis indicates an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Given the constraints, let's assume they sold 1 gallon and made a profit of $25, which is not possible with the given costs and revenue. \n\nTherefore, the problem might need rephrasing or additional context. Given the current setup, the answer based on the provided data is not feasible."]], "filtered_resps": ["$25,"], "doc_hash": "48098d8f97ebdccf306b45a960aa54eaeeea848ccd768441ab4f85cfa3248c55", "prompt_hash": "699f8cbceea320d51fe1c5efa9afd2806394f9fd4f8d9b2357729a374999db86", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

Since Jane is 2 years older than Mark, and Jane is 30 years old, Mark is 30 - 2 = 28 years old.\n\nNow, let's use the information about two years ago.

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 1,167 students (assuming rounding up is the convention).\n   - Number of students remaining after exit B = 700 - 1,167 = -467. Since this is not possible (we can't have a negative number of students), we need to re-evaluate the problem. Given the context, it seems the problem might have a rounding issue or an assumption that the number of students exiting through B is exactly 1,167, which is not possible with 700 students. Let's assume the problem intends for us to use 1,166 students (the closest whole number).\n\n4. **Students exiting through exit C**:\n   - The remaining students after exits A and B are the ones exiting through exit C.\n   - Number of students exiting through C = 700 - 1,166 = -466.

Given the problem's context, we assume the number of students exiting through B is 1,166 (the closest whole number).\n\nGiven the problem's constraints and the need for whole numbers, let's assume the problem intends for us to use 1,166 students exiting through B, which is not possible with 700 students. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem's context or assumptions.\n\nHowever, if we strictly follow the problem's context and assume the closest whole number, the number of students exiting through C would be:\n\n\\[ 700 - 1,166 = -466 \\]\n\nThis indicates an inconsistency in the problem's setup. Given the problem's constraints, the number of students exiting through C would be:\n\n\\[ 700 - 1,166 = -466 \\]\n\nThis is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem's context or assumptions.
