We know there are 700 bees in total.\n2. Let's denote the number of worker bees as W, the number of drone bees as D, and the number of queen bees as Q.\n3. According to the problem, there are two times more worker bees than drone bees: W = 2D\n4. There are two times more drone bees than queen bees: D = 2Q\n5. We also know that the total number of bees is 700: W + D + Q = 700\n\nNow let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom D = 2Q, we can substitute D in the total bees equation:\nW + 2Q + Q = 700\nW + 3Q = 700\n\nFrom W = 2D, we can substitute W in the total bees equation:\n2D + D + Q = 700\n3D + Q = 700\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n1) W + 3Q = 700\n2) 3D + Q = 700\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. First, let's express W in terms of Q from the first equation:\nW = 700 - 3Q\n\nNow substitute this into the second equation:\n3D + Q = 700\n3D + (700 - 3Q) = 700\n3D = 3Q\nD = Q\n\nNow we know that the number of drone bees (D) is equal to the number of queen bees (Q). So we can substitute D = Q in the total bees equation:\nW + 3Q = 700\nW + 3Q = 700\nW + 3Q = 700\nW + 3Q = 700\nW + 3Q = 700\n\nSince W = 2D and D = Q, we can substitute W = 2Q:\n2Q + 3Q = 700\n5Q = 700\nQ = 140\n\nNow we know there are 140 queen bees. Since D = Q, there are also 140 drone bees.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of worker bees (W):\nW = 700 - 3Q\nW = 700 - 3(140)\nW = 700 - 420\nW = 280\n\nSo, there are 280 worker bees in the hive."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "e9d3c67a2642f9f3e345973b0c94cfc7dcf58f97f0ddee0cf6bde1a09bc4fe4e", "prompt_hash": "82923e29903623b3e3b5deb16e3df5de0a374a71d02e6319c76cc99193821937", "target_hash": "26d228663f13a88592a12d16cf9587caab0388b262d6d9f126ed62f9333aca94", "exact_match": 0.0}

Since Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee takes 38 seconds, Gerald takes 38 + 2 = 40 seconds to complete the race.\n\nGerald's initial speed is therefore 400 meters / 40 seconds = 10 meters/second.\n\nNow, let's calculate Gerald's improved speed after his diet change. A 10% improvement means his new speed is 10 meters/second * 1.10 = 11 meters/second.\n\nFinally, we can calculate how much faster Gerald can now run the race. The difference in speed is 11 meters/second - 10 meters/second = 1 meter/second.\n\nSince the race is 400 meters, Gerald can now complete the race in 400 meters / 1 meter/second = 400 seconds.\n\nTo find out how many seconds faster Gerald can now run the race, we subtract his original time from his new time: 400 seconds - 40 seconds = 360 seconds.\n\nSo, Gerald can now run the race 360 seconds faster than before."]], "filtered_resps": ["360"], "doc_hash": "78495bc9a5c173af1a4b81febbad14b384ceba08d372e16bb4d28c43e1d3600f", "prompt_hash": "dc7a55ed77f06c9307f5b3b755a33f868c73f013fb00d995912db02802d0e2be", "target_hash": "76a50887d8f1c2e9301755428990ad81479ee21c25b43215cf524541e0503269", "exact_match": 0.0}

We know there are 700 bees in total.\n2. Let's denote the number of worker bees as W, the number of drone bees as D, and the number of queen bees as Q.\n3. According to the problem, there are two times more worker bees than drone bees: W = 2D\n4. There are two times more drone bees than queen bees: D = 2Q\n5. We also know that the total number of bees is 700: W + D + Q = 700\n\nNow let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom D = 2Q, we can substitute D in the total bees equation:\nW + 2Q + Q = 700\nW + 3Q = 700\n\nFrom W = 2D, we can substitute W in the total bees equation:\n2D + D + Q = 700\n3D + Q = 700\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n1) W + 3Q = 700\n2) 3D + Q = 700\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. First, let's express W in terms of Q from the first equation:\nW = 700 - 3Q\n\nNow substitute this into the second equation:\n3D + Q = 700\n3D + (700 - 3Q) = 700\n3D = 3Q\nD = Q\n\nNow we know that the number of drone bees (D) is equal to the number of queen bees (Q). So we can substitute D = Q in the total bees equation:\nW + 3Q = 700\nW + 3Q = 700\nW + 3Q = 700\nW + 3Q = 700\nW + 3Q = 700\n\nSince W = 2D and D = Q, we can substitute W = 2Q:\n2Q + 3Q = 700\n5Q = 700\nQ = 140\n\nNow we know there are 140 queen bees. Since D = Q, there are also 140 drone bees.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of worker bees (W):\nW = 700 - 3Q\nW = 700 - 3(140)\nW = 700 - 420\nW = 280\n\nSo, there are 280 worker bees in the hive."]], "filtered_resps": ["280"], "doc_hash": "e9d3c67a2642f9f3e345973b0c94cfc7dcf58f97f0ddee0cf6bde1a09bc4fe4e", "prompt_hash": "82923e29903623b3e3b5deb16e3df5de0a374a71d02e6319c76cc99193821937", "target_hash": "26d228663f13a88592a12d16cf9587caab0388b262d6d9f126ed62f9333aca94", "exact_match": 0.0}
