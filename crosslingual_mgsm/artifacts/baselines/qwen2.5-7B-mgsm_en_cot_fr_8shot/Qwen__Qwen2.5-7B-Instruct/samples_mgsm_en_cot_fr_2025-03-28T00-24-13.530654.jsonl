Each jouet weighs 1/2 of a pound.\n   - To find out how many jouets need to be removed, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one jouet.\n   - So, the number of jouets to be removed is 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15 jouets.\n\nThe answer is that Uriah needs to remove 15 jouets."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "ca9c64e1fdc3fd81728ef73fb2f526ba9f8b3dbde86617e805de8bc166ce7328", "prompt_hash": "c713cf2a7f28a44f777aa621436f37c25ff5894f189de063eeb8e46965a74b76", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

First, we need to determine Sylvie's monthly salary after she has been with the company for 5 years. Since she is eligible for the 10% bonus, her initial monthly salary is $600, and the bonus adds 10% to this amount.\n   - Initial monthly salary: $600\n   - Bonus: 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60\n   - Total monthly salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660\n\n2. Now, we need to calculate her monthly salary after three more years of service. Since the bonus is only given to employees with 5 years of service, and she has just reached that milestone, her salary will remain at $660 per month for the next three years.\n\n3. To find her annual salary after these three years, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 (months in a year).\n   - Annual salary: $660 * 12 = $7,920\n\n4. Since we are asked for her salary after three years of additional service, we need to calculate the total salary over these three years.\n   - Total annual salary for three years: $7,920 * 3 = $23,760\n\nTherefore, Sylvie's salary after three years of additional service will be $23,760."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "1b22eb02ba49ff16afa28e884dfd4354ec7bc7faa3960b9c12ef908b09df4ffe", "prompt_hash": "d4c972c8bd653e5e98b06c53316940e57ea5b087ad50e9f7fe7968b8920cb281", "target_hash": "dc8dca4b0608d397de8e57b2de450322b4ef1c42cfb1e2eab0524fd4ec3ef20e", "exact_match": 0.0}

First, we need to find out how long it took Gérald to run the 400 meters before he improved his time. Since Lee was 2 seconds faster, and Lee now runs it in 38 seconds, Gérald originally took 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.\n\n2. Gérald improved his time by 10%.

Quatre ans plus tard, ce salaire avait augmenté et était de 40 % plus élevé que celui qu'il gagnait au départ. Si les salaires d'Adrien et de Lylah ont augmenté simultanément, et qu'Adrien gagnait 40 000 $ il y a quatre ans, calculez le montant total de leurs deux salaires quatre ans plus tard.\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Step-by-Step Answer:\n\n1. Adrien's initial salary was $40,000.\n2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years. So, the increase in Adrien's salary is 40% of $40,000, which is 0.40 * $40,000 = $16,000.\n3. Therefore, Adrien's salary four years later is $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.\n\nNow, let's find Lylah's initial salary:\n1. Adrien's initial salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \\( L \\).\n2. So, Adrien's initial salary = \\( L + 0.30L = 1.30L \\).\n3. We know Adrien's initial salary was $40,000, so \\( 1.30L = 40,000 \\).\n4. Solving for \\( L \\), we get \\( L = \\frac{40,000}{1.30} \\approx 30,769.23 \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate Lylah's salary four years later:\n1. Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, which is 40%.\n2. The increase in Lylah's salary is 40% of $30,769.23, which is 0.40 * $30,769.23 = $12,307.69.\n3. Therefore, Lylah's salary four years later is $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total of their two salaries four years later:\n1. Adrien's salary four years later is $56,000.\n2. Lylah's salary four years later is $43,076.92.\n3. The total of their two salaries is $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92.\n\nThe answer is $99,076.92."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "5acff9eb42a47e1d880e4153c9fe6d5d98b02db017fe137b1cf25a68284a215e", "prompt_hash": "17dc64f4bc30767c2254e162caca0d7edd995db8c56e401e129b73cfc4d341ff", "target_hash": "c3dd3155bfb41ce88db8cb3949533694746fe2767aeea3faba904b50baabfca6", "exact_match": 0.0}

First, we need to determine Sylvie's monthly salary after she has been with the company for 5 years. Since she is eligible for the 10% bonus, her initial monthly salary is $600, and the bonus adds 10% to this amount.\n   - Initial monthly salary: $600\n   - Bonus: 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60\n   - Total monthly salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660\n\n2. Now, we need to calculate her monthly salary after three more years of service. Since the bonus is only given to employees with 5 years of service, and she has just reached that milestone, her salary will remain at $660 per month for the next three years.\n\n3. To find her annual salary after these three years, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 (months in a year).\n   - Annual salary: $660 * 12 = $7,920\n\n4. Since we are asked for her salary after three years of additional service, we need to calculate the total salary over these three years.\n   - Total annual salary for three years: $7,920 * 3 = $23,760\n\nTherefore, Sylvie's salary after three years of additional service will be $23,760."]], "filtered_resps": ["$23,760."], "doc_hash": "1b22eb02ba49ff16afa28e884dfd4354ec7bc7faa3960b9c12ef908b09df4ffe", "prompt_hash": "d4c972c8bd653e5e98b06c53316940e57ea5b087ad50e9f7fe7968b8920cb281", "target_hash": "dc8dca4b0608d397de8e57b2de450322b4ef1c42cfb1e2eab0524fd4ec3ef20e", "exact_match": 0.0}

Adrien's initial salary was $40,000.\n2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years. So, the increase in Adrien's salary is 40% of $40,000, which is 0.40 * $40,000 = $16,000.\n3. Therefore, Adrien's salary four years later is $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.\n\nNow, let's find Lylah's initial salary:\n1. Adrien's initial salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \\( L \\).\n2. So, Adrien's initial salary = \\( L + 0.30L = 1.30L \\).\n3. We know Adrien's initial salary was $40,000, so \\( 1.30L = 40,000 \\).\n4. Solving for \\( L \\), we get \\( L = \\frac{40,000}{1.30} \\approx 30,769.23 \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate Lylah's salary four years later:\n1. Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, which is 40%.\n2. The increase in Lylah's salary is 40% of $30,769.23, which is 0.40 * $30,769.23 = $12,307.69.\n3. Therefore, Lylah's salary four years later is $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total of their two salaries four years later:\n1. Adrien's salary four years later is $56,000.\n2. Lylah's salary four years later is $43,076.92.\n3.

First, calculate the cost of the half-dozen of plates:\n   - The cost of one half-dozen of plates is $6,000.\n   - Therefore, the cost of a dozen of plates is $6,000 * 2 = $12,000.\n   - So, the cost of a half-dozen of plates is $12,000 / 2 = $6,000.\n\n2. The problem states that 20 dozen of mugs cost $1,200 less than the cost of a half-dozen of plates:\n   - The cost of a half-dozen of plates is $6,000.\n   - Therefore, the cost of 20 dozen of mugs is $6,000 - $1,200 = $4,800.\n\n3. Now, calculate the cost of one mug:\n   - 20 dozen of mugs is 20 * 12 = 240 mugs.\n   - The cost of 240 mugs is $4,800.\n   - Therefore, the cost of one mug is $4,800 / 240 = $20.\n\nThe answer is that the price of one mug is $20."]], "filtered_resps": ["$20."], "doc_hash": "7a49d41230b943abc81c77d955d1ae375ca06dae8761585d2b38d329d7dfafaa", "prompt_hash": "5622e985eca6325c0a14efdc611de29950a0481bb7ced7cc9e8a496f517040f4", "target_hash": "be47addbcb8f60566a3d7fd5a36f8195798e2848b368195d9a5d20e007c59a0c", "exact_match": 0.0}
