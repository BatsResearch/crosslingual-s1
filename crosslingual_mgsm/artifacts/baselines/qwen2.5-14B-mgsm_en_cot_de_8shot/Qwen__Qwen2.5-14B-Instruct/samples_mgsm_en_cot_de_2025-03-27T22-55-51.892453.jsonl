Since the drink is two-thirds water, the spilled liter also contains two-thirds water and one-third pure orange juice. Therefore, the amount of water spilled is \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{2}{3}\\) liters, and the amount of pure orange juice spilled is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}\\) liters.\n\n3. **Remaining Orangengetränk**: After spilling 1 liter, the remaining orange drink is \\(10 - 1 = 9\\) liters. The remaining water in the orange drink is \\(\\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\\) liters, and the remaining pure orange juice is \\(\\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3\\) liters.\n\n4. **Ananasgetränk Composition**: You want to add enough water to make 15 liters of pineapple drink, which is three-fifths water. This means that the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink should be \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times 15 = 9\\) liters, and the amount of pure pineapple juice should be \\(15 - 9 = 6\\) liters.\n\n5. **Total Volume After Mixing**: You want the final volume to be 24 liters. Since you already have 9 liters of the remaining orange drink (which contains 6 liters of water and 3 liters of pure orange juice), you need to add \\(24 - 9 = 15\\) liters of water to reach the total volume of 24 liters.\n\n6. **Final Water Content**: The final mixture will contain the 6 liters of water from the orange drink plus the 15 liters of water you added, totaling \\(6 + 15 = 21\\) liters of water.\n\nTherefore, in the final 24 liters of the mixture, there are 21 liters of water."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "26077058a6b102b5b20649b0f8c0f3b95ca04e42397e0bebd29d581fde5889fd", "prompt_hash": "658287da41a1154e9f97509984c1bf4bc2116ef1e00efcc0edbea7b163cda121", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

Da Brinley die niedrigste Punktzahl streichen kann, wird sie die 71 Punkte weglassen, wenn sie eine höhere Punktzahl im sechsten Test erzielt. Also muss sie im sechsten Test mindestens 465 - (438 - 71) = 465 - 367 = 98 Punkte erzielen, um einen Gesamtdurchschnitt von 93 zu erreichen.\n\nDie Antwort ist, dass Brinley im sechsten Test mindestens 98 Punkte erzielen muss."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "2387c7cd82ea14b1fa26b608c8ff8552c2af05a5acf68cb4d47b647fcb6c78f8", "prompt_hash": "854c3c722de40c424c7e20df754a672aa1df5f799d70e9a99f2e9582c2514696", "target_hash": "29db0c6782dbd5000559ef4d9e953e300e2b479eed26d887ef3f92b921c06a67", "exact_match": 0.0}

This means that the amount of water in the orange drink is \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 10 = \\frac{20}{3}\\) liters, and the amount of pure orange juice is \\(10 - \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{30}{3} - \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{10}{3}\\) liters.\n\n2. **Spill of Orangengetränk**: You spill 1 liter of the orange drink. Since the drink is two-thirds water, the spilled liter also contains two-thirds water and one-third pure orange juice. Therefore, the amount of water spilled is \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{2}{3}\\) liters, and the amount of pure orange juice spilled is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}\\) liters.\n\n3. **Remaining Orangengetränk**: After spilling 1 liter, the remaining orange drink is \\(10 - 1 = 9\\) liters. The remaining water in the orange drink is \\(\\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\\) liters, and the remaining pure orange juice is \\(\\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3\\) liters.\n\n4. **Ananasgetränk Composition**: You want to add enough water to make 15 liters of pineapple drink, which is three-fifths water. This means that the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink should be \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times 15 = 9\\) liters, and the amount of pure pineapple juice should be \\(15 - 9 = 6\\) liters.\n\n5. **Total Volume After Mixing**: You want the final volume to be 24 liters. Since you already have 9 liters of the remaining orange drink (which contains 6 liters of water and 3 liters of pure orange juice), you need to add \\(24 - 9 = 15\\) liters of water to reach the total volume of 24 liters.\n\n6. **Final Water Content**: The final mixture will contain the 6 liters of water from the orange drink plus the 15 liters of water you added, totaling \\(6 + 15 = 21\\) liters of water.\n\nTherefore, in the final 24 liters of the mixture, there are 21 liters of water."]], "filtered_resps": ["21"], "doc_hash": "26077058a6b102b5b20649b0f8c0f3b95ca04e42397e0bebd29d581fde5889fd", "prompt_hash": "658287da41a1154e9f97509984c1bf4bc2116ef1e00efcc0edbea7b163cda121", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

Er erlaubt den Studenten jedes Semester, die niedrigste Punktzahl aus dem Durchschnitt zu streichen. Wenn Brinley in den ersten fünf Tests Punktzahlen von 89, 71, 92, 100 und 86 hat, welche Punktzahl braucht sie dann im sechsten Test, um einen Durchschnitt von 93 zu erreichen?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Um herauszufinden, welche Punktzahl Brinley im sechsten Test erzielen muss, um einen Durchschnitt von 93 zu erreichen, müssen wir die folgenden Schritte durchführen:\n\n1. Berechnen, wie hoch der Gesamtpunktestand für einen Durchschnitt von 93 sein muss. Da Mr. Bert die niedrigste Punktzahl streicht, wird Brinley nur die Punkte aus den fünf höchsten Tests in den Durchschnitt einbeziehen. Also, für einen Durchschnitt von 93 über 5 Tests muss sie insgesamt 93 * 5 = 465 Punkte haben.\n\n2. Berechnen, welche Punktzahl Brinley im sechsten Test erzielen muss, um insgesamt 465 Punkte zu haben. Zuerst berechnen wir die Summe der Punkte aus den ersten fünf Tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 Punkte.\n\n3. Da Brinley die niedrigste Punktzahl streichen kann, wird sie die 71 Punkte weglassen, wenn sie eine höhere Punktzahl im sechsten Test erzielt. Also muss sie im sechsten Test mindestens 465 - (438 - 71) = 465 - 367 = 98 Punkte erzielen, um einen Gesamtdurchschnitt von 93 zu erreichen.\n\nDie Antwort ist, dass Brinley im sechsten Test mindestens 98 Punkte erzielen muss."]], "filtered_resps": ["98"], "doc_hash": "2387c7cd82ea14b1fa26b608c8ff8552c2af05a5acf68cb4d47b647fcb6c78f8", "prompt_hash": "854c3c722de40c424c7e20df754a672aa1df5f799d70e9a99f2e9582c2514696", "target_hash": "29db0c6782dbd5000559ef4d9e953e300e2b479eed26d887ef3f92b921c06a67", "exact_match": 1.0}
