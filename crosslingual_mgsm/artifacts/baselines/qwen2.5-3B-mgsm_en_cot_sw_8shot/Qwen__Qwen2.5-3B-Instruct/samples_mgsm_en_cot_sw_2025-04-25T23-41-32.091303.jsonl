She then checked her emails 4 times in the last hour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of times she checked her emails:\n- In the first hour: 4 times\n- In the next hour: 2 times, but only 1 was successful, so 1 successful check.\n\nSo, the total number of successful checks is:\n4 (from the first hour) + 1 (from the next hour) = 5 successful checks.\n\nSince she initially had 12 emails and she received 5 successful checks, she now has:\n12 (initial emails) + 5 (successful checks) = 17 emails.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many times she will check her emails in the next hour to reach a total of 20 emails. Since she currently has 17 emails, she needs:\n20 (desired total) - 17 (current total) = 3 more emails.\n\nSince she checks her emails 4 times in an hour and only 1 of those checks is successful, she will need 3 successful checks in the next hour. Given that she checks 4 times in an hour, she will need to check 3 more times to get 3 successful checks.\n\nTherefore, she will check her emails 3 more times in the next hour to reach a total of 20 emails.\n\nThe answer is: 3."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "d3ff3c31631a0fe9aeb6fc6f33d4a150fb26b9a2070857d5f9206a7ac8a633da", "prompt_hash": "533f5384af4c0bcf1265341d86e5f95a42ed77dd5b03c13605f8d70552404df1", "target_hash": "e7f6c011776e8db7cd330b54174fd76f7d0216b612387a5ffcfb81e6f0919683", "exact_match": 0.0}

The total calories from gramu should be 300 calories per gram.\n\nFrom the first condition, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 250x + 300y = 1800 \\]\n\nWe need to find non-negative integer solutions for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy this equation. Let's simplify the equation by dividing everything by 50:\n\\[ 5x + 6y = 36 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find integer values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy this equation. We can solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[ 5x = 36 - 6y \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{36 - 6y}{5} \\]\n\nFor \\( x \\) to be an integer, \\( 36 - 6y \\) must be divisible by 5. Let's test values of \\( y \\) to find valid solutions:\n\n1. If \\( y = 0 \\):\n   \\[ x = \\frac{36 - 6 \\cdot 0}{5} = \\frac{36}{5} = 7.2 \\] (not an integer)\n\n2.

According to the problem, the book is divided into 1/4 and 1/2 portions. This means:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}P + \\frac{1}{2}P = P \\]\n\nTo find the total number of pages, we can combine the fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}P + \\frac{2}{4}P = \\frac{3}{4}P \\]\n\nSince the total is \\( \\frac{3}{4}P \\), the remaining 1/4 of the book is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}P \\]\n\nGiven that the book is 30 pages, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}P = 30 \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we multiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ P = 30 \\times 4 = 120 \\]\n\nSo, the book has 120 pages in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pages are assigned to the 30 pages that are being opened. The book is divided into 1/4 and 1/2 portions. Let's calculate the number of pages in each portion:\n\n- 1/4 of the book: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 120 = 30 \\) pages\n- 1/2 of the book: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 120 = 60 \\) pages\n\nNow, we know that 30 pages are being opened, and these pages are split between the 1/4 and 1/2 portions. We need to find out how many pages are assigned to the 30 pages that are being opened.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of pages from the 1/4 portion and \\( y \\) be the number of pages from the 1/2 portion. We have:\n\n\\[ x + y = 30 \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) is from the 1/4 portion and \\( y \\) is from the 1/2 portion, we can express \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in terms of the total pages:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 120 = 30 \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 120 = 60 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( x + y = 30 \\), we need to find the number of pages assigned to the 30 pages that are being opened. Since the 30 pages are split between the 1/4 and 1/2 portions, we need to determine the ratio of these portions.\n\nThe ratio of the 1/4 portion to the 1/2 portion is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{60} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nThis means that for every 30 pages being opened, 1/2 of them come from the 1/4 portion and the other 1/2 come from the 1/2 portion.\n\nSince the 30 pages are being opened, and the 1/4 portion has 30 pages, the number of pages assigned to the 30 pages that are being opened is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Pages from 1/4 portion} = 30 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Pages from 1/2 portion} = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages assigned to the 30 pages that are being opened is:\n\n\\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \\]\n\nSo, the number of pages that are being opened is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "fdecf67de6da0afec236c58090994e56df3cde3e9058d3d84d07f13f2637bde5", "prompt_hash": "d6eddb930e3341d0a9ad0dbc9b2761493f1b7675d08ad12abcb8e63c23a3702e", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

Given the problem constraints, it seems there's an error in the problem setup.\n\nHowever, if we strictly follow the problem as stated and assume the pieces given away are the sum of the two conditions:\n   - Total pieces given away: 628\n   - Since he can't give away more than he has, the correct interpretation should be that he can only give away 500 pieces (the original amount).\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces he has left is:\n\\[\n500 - 500 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, Johnny has 0 pieces left."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "ef7bfd34152b9c5ad2fa54a8c59d8c6c1c517b2a71e9b22509c20b5b380afca3", "prompt_hash": "fd338cbb29f0578366a685abec77e0acd26fffdf2f1a3a85a45803beee4aa9e3", "target_hash": "43e8852bef636588d357c96ae642844aa7425d8fb73445cc4f017dbd6f5ab6e3", "exact_match": 0.0}

Ataokoa pesa ngapi iwapo atampa mhasibu kazi hiyo?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["First, let's determine how much money Jackie earns in one day.\n\nJackie works 3 shifts per day, and each shift earns her $35. Therefore, her daily earnings are:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ shifts/day} \\times \\$35/\\text{shift} = \\$105/\\text{day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it will take for Jackie to earn $90. We do this by dividing the total amount of money she needs by her daily earnings:\n\\[ \\frac{\\$90}{\\$105/\\text{day}} \\]\n\nTo simplify this, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:\n\\[ \\frac{\\$90 \\div 15}{\\$105 \\div 15} = \\frac{6}{7} \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSince Jackie cannot work a fraction of a day in this context, we need to determine how many full days it will take for her to earn at least $90. We can calculate the earnings for each full day and see when she reaches or exceeds $90.\n\n- After 1 day: \\( \\$105 \\)\n- After 2 days: \\( \\$105 \\times 2 = \\$210 \\)\n\nSince $210 is more than $90, Jackie will have earned $90 after 2 full days of work.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many lollipops she can buy with $90. If we assume each lollipop costs $1 (since the cost per lollipop is not specified in the question, we'll use this common assumption for simplicity), then with $90, she can buy:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ lollipops} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of lollipops Jackie can buy with $90 is:\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "4a3294ce84dd41b323afab4a7431b660da284f995d608b77e2c2c119d0f8ebc2", "prompt_hash": "a79b038983fc5666b07eab25ae296c707897627478392bc7aa42cdff7b8f3466", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

Kwa kutumia maelezo haya, timu iliyo na mbio ya haraka zaidi itashinda kwa sekunde ngapi?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions under which the cars stop. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: There are 2 cars in the parking lot, and each car is moving at a speed such that they each stop after 400 meters.\n\n2. **First Car**: The first car stops after traveling 400 meters. This means it takes 400 meters / speed of the car = 400 meters to stop.\n\n3. **Second Car**: The second car stops after traveling 400 meters as well. This means it also takes 400 meters / speed of the car = 400 meters to stop.\n\n4. **Additional Condition**: The problem states that each car stops after traveling 400 meters, and each car stops at a different point. This implies that the cars are stopping at different points along the 400 meters.\n\n5. **Speed Comparison**: The problem also mentions that the second car stops 55 seconds after the first car. This means the second car is traveling faster than the first car.\n\n6. **Speed Calculation**: If the first car takes 400 meters / speed to stop, and the second car takes 400 meters / (speed - 55 meters/second) to stop, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of first car}} = \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of second car} - 55}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{speed of first car} = \\text{speed of second car} - 55\n   \\]\n\n7. **Stopping Time Calculation**: The time taken to stop is the distance divided by the speed. For the first car:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for first car} = \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of first car}}\n   \\]\n   For the second car:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for second car} = \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of second car} - 55}\n   \\]\n   Given that the second car stops 55 seconds after the first car:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of second car} - 55} = \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of first car}} + 55\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solving the Equation**: Let's denote the speed of the first car as \\( v_1 \\) and the speed of the second car as \\( v_2 \\). From the equation \\( v_1 = v_2 - 55 \\), we substitute into the time equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{v_2 - 55} = \\frac{400}{v_2} + 55\n   \\]\n   Multiplying through by \\( v_2 (v_2 - 55) \\) to clear the denominators:\n   \\[\n   400v_2 = 400(v_2 - 55) + 55v_2(v_2 - 55)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   400v_2 = 400v_2 - 22000 + 55v_2^2 - 3075v_2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0 = 55v_2^2 - 3075v_2 - 22000\n   \\]\n   Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( v_2 = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\):\n   \\[\n   v_2 = \\frac{3075 \\pm \\sqrt{3075^2 + 4 \\cdot 55 \\cdot 22000}}{2 \\cdot 55}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v_2 = \\frac{3075 \\pm \\sqrt{9455625 + 4840000}}{110}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v_2 = \\frac{3075 \\pm \\sqrt{14295625}}{110}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v_2 = \\frac{3075 \\pm 3780}{110}\n   \\]\n   Taking the positive root:\n   \\[\n   v_2 = \\frac{6855}{110} \\approx 62.32 \\text{ meters/second}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( v_1 = 62.32 - 55 = 7.32 \\text{ meters/second} \\).\n\n9. **Stopping Time Comparison**: The time taken by the first car:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for first car} = \\frac{400}{7.32} \\approx 54.93 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n   The time taken by the second car:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for second car} = \\frac{400}{62.32 - 55} = \\frac{400}{7.32} \\approx 54.93 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n10. **Conclusion**: Both cars take approximately 54.93 seconds to stop. Therefore, the time taken by the first car is slightly less than the time taken by the second car.\n\nThus, the first car stops in approximately 54.93 seconds, which is less than the 55 seconds mentioned in the problem. The answer is that the first car stops in fewer seconds than the second car."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "b30d79792fee02cc4fc6b8379f2fa72d327f0f1aa1643aaaf947489e4a12ea12", "prompt_hash": "ec855f0b4b54260cd6344e19605eb57c36d75218784990b4e43d57d1f87b1327", "target_hash": "d4735e3a265e16eee03f59718b9b5d03019c07d8b6c51f90da3a666eec13ab35", "exact_match": 0.0}

The problem states that the 2 new cars (kidimbwi kikubwa) brought 2 more lollipops (mara mbili) than the original 3 cars (kidimbwi kidogo) had.\n\nLet's denote the number of lollipops in the original 3 cars as \\( x \\). Therefore, the 2 new cars brought \\( x + 2 \\) lollipops.\n\nThe total number of lollipops after the new cars arrive is:\n\\[ x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2 \\]\n\nWe know that the total number of cars is now 5, and the total number of lollipops is \\( 2x + 2 \\).\n\n4. The problem then states that after the 2 new cars arrived, the 5 cars now have a total of 2 more lollipops than the original 3 cars. So, the total number of lollipops is:\n\\[ 2x + 2 \\]\n\n5. The original 3 cars had \\( x \\) lollipops, and the 2 new cars brought \\( x + 2 \\) lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops is:\n\\[ x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2 \\]\n\n6. Now, the problem states that the 5 cars now have 2 more lollipops than the original 3 cars. So, the total number of lollipops is:\n\\[ x + 2 + 2 = x + 4 \\]\n\nSince the total number of lollipops is the same in both scenarios, we equate the two expressions:\n\\[ 2x + 2 = x + 4 \\]\n\n7. Solving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 2x + 2 = x + 4 \\]\n\\[ 2x - x = 4 - 2 \\]\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the original 3 cars had 2 lollipops each. Therefore, the 2 new cars brought \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) lollipops.\n\n8. Now, we need to determine how many lollipops are in each car after the new cars arrived:\n- The original 3 cars each have 2 lollipops, so the total for the original 3 cars is \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) lollipops.\n- The 2 new cars each have \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) lollipops, so the total for the 2 new cars is \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) lollipops.\n\n9. Adding these together, the total number of lollipops is:\n\\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \\]\n\n10. Now, we need to determine how many lollipops are in each car:\n- The 5 cars now have 14 lollipops in total.\n- The original 3 cars each have 2 lollipops, so the total for the original 3 cars is 6 lollipops.\n- The 2 new cars each have 4 lollipops, so the total for the 2 new cars is 8 lollipops.\n\nSince the total number of lollipops is 14 and the original 3 cars have 6 lollipops, the 2 new cars must have:\n\\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \\] lollipops.\n\nTherefore, the 2 new cars each have 4 lollipops, and the original 3 cars each have 2 lollipops.\n\nSo, the number of lollipops in the original 3 cars is 2 each, and the number of lollipops in the 2 new cars is 4 each.\n\nThe answer is that the original 3 cars each have 2 lollipops, and the 2 new cars each have 4 lollipops."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "6bf1051bb2a53b896c8454ad2d7f0efeb043eab7504fc199f49aa6b0518388ee", "prompt_hash": "0c1e6d9eee96f011e786aa6e89ceec2f6a574b00bc5562d77e34e953e1cb1eed", "target_hash": "2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3", "exact_match": 0.0}

Jason has 1000 minutes of simu (time) each month.\n2. Each day, he uses 15 minutes of his simu and loses 20% of his remaining simu.\n3. At the end of the month, he uses an additional 300 minutes of simu.\n4. We need to find out how much simu Jason has left at the end of a 30-day month.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much simu Jason uses each day:\n\n- Each day, Jason uses 15 minutes of his simu.\n- At the end of each day, he loses 20% of his remaining simu.\n\nLet's denote the remaining simu at the end of day \\( n \\) as \\( S_n \\).\n\n**Day 1:**\n- Initial simu: 1000 minutes\n- Simu used: 15 minutes\n- Remaining simu: \\( 1000 - 15 = 985 \\) minutes\n- Simu lost: \\( 0.20 \\times 985 = 197 \\) minutes\n- Remaining simu at the end of day 1: \\( 985 - 197 = 788 \\) minutes\n\n**Day 2:**\n- Initial simu: 788 minutes\n- Simu used: 15 minutes\n- Remaining simu: \\( 788 - 15 = 773 \\) minutes\n- Simu lost: \\( 0.20 \\times 773 = 154.6 \\) minutes\n- Remaining simu at the end of day 2: \\( 773 - 154.6 = 618.4 \\) minutes\n\nWe can see that the remaining simu decreases each day by 15 minutes and then by 20% of the remaining simu. This process repeats for 30 days.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can use the fact that the remaining simu after each day can be approximated by a geometric series. However, for a more straightforward approach, we can calculate the remaining simu after 30 days directly.\n\n**General formula for remaining simu after \\( n \\) days:**\n\\[ S_n = S_0 \\times (1 - 0.20)^n - 15n \\]\nwhere \\( S_0 = 1000 \\) and \\( n = 30 \\).\n\n\\[ S_{30} = 1000 \\times (0.80)^{30} - 15 \\times 30 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (0.80)^{30} \\):\n\\[ (0.80)^{30} \\approx 0.0115 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the remaining simu:\n\\[ S_{30} = 1000 \\times 0.0115 - 450 \\]\n\\[ S_{30} = 11.5 - 450 \\]\n\\[ S_{30} = -438.5 \\]\n\nSince the remaining simu cannot be negative, it means Jason has used up all his simu and more by the end of the 30th day.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the 30th day, Jason has **0 minutes** of simu left."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "62d8a28eb9f180f7c4d312c60414dc0c800ab2cba21c8621b137b2b419ab7f2a", "prompt_hash": "3636d7dc3082e892754bc5c7dbdbbee6bebc904df22938daf682fb3aeb702551", "target_hash": "1e472b39b105d349bcd069c4a711b44a2fffb8e274714bb07ecfff69a9a7f67b", "exact_match": 0.0}

She then checked her emails 4 times in the last hour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of times she checked her emails:\n- In the first hour: 4 times\n- In the next hour: 2 times, but only 1 was successful, so 1 successful check.\n\nSo, the total number of successful checks is:\n4 (from the first hour) + 1 (from the next hour) = 5 successful checks.\n\nSince she initially had 12 emails and she received 5 successful checks, she now has:\n12 (initial emails) + 5 (successful checks) = 17 emails.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many times she will check her emails in the next hour to reach a total of 20 emails. Since she currently has 17 emails, she needs:\n20 (desired total) - 17 (current total) = 3 more emails.\n\nSince she checks her emails 4 times in an hour and only 1 of those checks is successful, she will need 3 successful checks in the next hour.

Iwapo mfuko wa gramu 300 una sehemu 5 za kupakuliwa, unaweza kula gramu ngapi iwapo lengo lako la kalori kila siku ni 2000 na tayari umekula kalori 1800?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["To solve this, we need to determine how many grams of chips and how many grams of gramu (rice) Kulingana should consume to meet the daily caloric intake of 2000 calories, while also ensuring that the caloric intake from chips is 250 calories per gram and from gramu is 300 calories per gram, with a total of 1800 calories to be consumed each day.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( x \\) as the grams of chips\n- \\( y \\) as the grams of gramu\n\nWe have two conditions:\n1. The total calories from chips and gramu should be 1800 calories.\n2. The total calories from chips should be 250 calories per gram.\n3. The total calories from gramu should be 300 calories per gram.\n\nFrom the first condition, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 250x + 300y = 1800 \\]\n\nWe need to find non-negative integer solutions for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy this equation. Let's simplify the equation by dividing everything by 50:\n\\[ 5x + 6y = 36 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find integer values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy this equation. We can solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[ 5x = 36 - 6y \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{36 - 6y}{5} \\]\n\nFor \\( x \\) to be an integer, \\( 36 - 6y \\) must be divisible by 5. Let's test values of \\( y \\) to find valid solutions:\n\n1. If \\( y = 0 \\):\n   \\[ x = \\frac{36 - 6 \\cdot 0}{5} = \\frac{36}{5} = 7.2 \\] (not an integer)\n\n2.

Akiondoa vitabu 30 vya futuhi, anahitaji kuondoa wanasesere wangapi?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["First, let's determine the total number of pages in the book. Since the book is divided into 1/4 and 1/2 portions, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:\n\nLet \\( P \\) be the total number of pages in the book. According to the problem, the book is divided into 1/4 and 1/2 portions. This means:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}P + \\frac{1}{2}P = P \\]\n\nTo find the total number of pages, we can combine the fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}P + \\frac{2}{4}P = \\frac{3}{4}P \\]\n\nSince the total is \\( \\frac{3}{4}P \\), the remaining 1/4 of the book is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}P \\]\n\nGiven that the book is 30 pages, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}P = 30 \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we multiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ P = 30 \\times 4 = 120 \\]\n\nSo, the book has 120 pages in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pages are assigned to the 30 pages that are being opened. The book is divided into 1/4 and 1/2 portions. Let's calculate the number of pages in each portion:\n\n- 1/4 of the book: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 120 = 30 \\) pages\n- 1/2 of the book: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 120 = 60 \\) pages\n\nNow, we know that 30 pages are being opened, and these pages are split between the 1/4 and 1/2 portions. We need to find out how many pages are assigned to the 30 pages that are being opened.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of pages from the 1/4 portion and \\( y \\) be the number of pages from the 1/2 portion. We have:\n\n\\[ x + y = 30 \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) is from the 1/4 portion and \\( y \\) is from the 1/2 portion, we can express \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in terms of the total pages:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 120 = 30 \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 120 = 60 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( x + y = 30 \\), we need to find the number of pages assigned to the 30 pages that are being opened. Since the 30 pages are split between the 1/4 and 1/2 portions, we need to determine the ratio of these portions.\n\nThe ratio of the 1/4 portion to the 1/2 portion is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{60} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nThis means that for every 30 pages being opened, 1/2 of them come from the 1/4 portion and the other 1/2 come from the 1/2 portion.\n\nSince the 30 pages are being opened, and the 1/4 portion has 30 pages, the number of pages assigned to the 30 pages that are being opened is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Pages from 1/4 portion} = 30 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Pages from 1/2 portion} = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages assigned to the 30 pages that are being opened is:\n\n\\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \\]\n\nSo, the number of pages that are being opened is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["60"], "doc_hash": "fdecf67de6da0afec236c58090994e56df3cde3e9058d3d84d07f13f2637bde5", "prompt_hash": "d6eddb930e3341d0a9ad0dbc9b2761493f1b7675d08ad12abcb8e63c23a3702e", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

The total capacity of the parking lot is 5000 cars.\n2. Each car parked at the parking lot has an initial parking fee of 15 shillings.\n3. The total parking fee collected is 3755 shillings.\n4. We need to find the number of cars that were parked without exceeding the initial parking fee of 15 shillings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total parking fee collected from cars that did not exceed the initial 15 shilling fee:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total fee collected from cars not exceeding 15 shillings} = 3755 \\text{ shillings} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cars were parked without exceeding the initial 15 shillings.

Therefore, the number of cars that paid the initial fee and the rest of the cars (those that did not exceed the initial fee) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cars} = 250 + \\text{Cars that did not exceed the initial fee} \\]\n\nSince the total capacity is 5000 cars, the number of cars that did not exceed the initial fee is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cars that did not exceed the initial fee} = 5000 - 250 = 4750 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cars in the parking lot is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cars} = 250 + 4750 = 5000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cars that were parked without exceeding the initial parking fee of 15 shillings is 4750."]], "filtered_resps": ["4750."], "doc_hash": "1c6723c3e3ba63d819cb929bb121eff477b94a8715b57291f096598076c60945", "prompt_hash": "b40654dce4c45ea0473ee3c9a1268b985f0e87426534eacf62d197c63dc8db69", "target_hash": "bbb965ab0c80d6538cf2184babad2a564a010376712012bd07b0af92dcd3097d", "exact_match": 0.0}

Initially, Poppy has 1000 vido (which I assume is a typo for \"vipo\" or \"vipoa,\" meaning \"villages\" in Kiswahili).\n\n2. Poppy can rob one village at a time, and her mother can take one village at a time as well.\n\n3. The question states that the villages will be taken over without any fighting, which means that the process of taking over the villages will be a straightforward one where Poppy and her mother will take turns.\n\n4. Since Poppy and her mother are taking turns, and assuming they start at the same time, they will take over the villages alternately.\n\n5. If we consider that there are 1000 villages, and they take turns, the number of turns will be equal to the number of villages, as each turn involves one village being taken over.\n\n6. Since there are 1000 villages and they take turns, Poppy will take over 500 villages, and her mother will also take over 500 villages.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that 500 villages will be taken over by Poppy and 500 villages will be taken over by her mother, leaving 0 villages unclaimed.

Johnny ataokota vipande vingapi iwapo ataokota lego zote?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Johnny starts with 500 Lego pieces.\n   - He gives away some pieces to a friend.\n   - He gives away 3 more pieces than he originally had.\n   - He gives away 1/4 of the total pieces he originally had.\n\n2. **Calculate the Pieces Given Away:**\n   - Let's denote the number of pieces Johnny originally had as \\( x \\).\n   - According to the problem, \\( x = 500 \\).\n   - He gives away 3 more pieces than he originally had: \\( x + 3 \\).\n   - He also gives away 1/4 of the total pieces he originally had: \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\).\n\n3. **Total Pieces Given Away:**\n   - The total pieces given away can be calculated by adding the pieces given away in both ways:\n     \\[\n     x + 3 + \\frac{x}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( x = 500 \\):\n     \\[\n     500 + 3 + \\frac{500}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the fraction:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{500}{4} = 125\n     \\]\n   - So, the total pieces given away is:\n     \\[\n     500 + 3 + 125 = 628\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Remaining Pieces:**\n   - Johnny originally had 500 pieces.\n   - He gave away 628 pieces.\n   - Since he can't give away more pieces than he has, it's clear there's an inconsistency in the problem statement. However, if we assume the problem meant to say he gave away 3 more pieces than he originally had and 1/4 of the total pieces he had, we can proceed with the given numbers.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Johnny originally had 500 pieces.\n   - He gave away 628 pieces, but since he can't give away more than he has, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement. Given the problem constraints, it seems there's an error in the problem setup.\n\nHowever, if we strictly follow the problem as stated and assume the pieces given away are the sum of the two conditions:\n   - Total pieces given away: 628\n   - Since he can't give away more than he has, the correct interpretation should be that he can only give away 500 pieces (the original amount).\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces he has left is:\n\\[\n500 - 500 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, Johnny has 0 pieces left."]], "filtered_resps": ["0"], "doc_hash": "ef7bfd34152b9c5ad2fa54a8c59d8c6c1c517b2a71e9b22509c20b5b380afca3", "prompt_hash": "fd338cbb29f0578366a685abec77e0acd26fffdf2f1a3a85a45803beee4aa9e3", "target_hash": "43e8852bef636588d357c96ae642844aa7425d8fb73445cc4f017dbd6f5ab6e3", "exact_match": 0.0}

Ikiwa Zaid analipwa $6000 kila mwezi, bado atakuwa amesalia na pesa ngapi baada ya matumizi yote na michango yote?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["To solve this, let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Amount and Additional Costs:**\n   - Zaid initially had $200.\n   - He spent $700 on a house and other miscellaneous expenses.\n   - Therefore, the total amount spent is $200 + $700 = $900.\n\n2. **Remaining Amount:**\n   - Zaid started with $6000.\n   - After spending $900, the remaining amount is $6000 - $900 = $5100.\n\n3. **Monthly Savings:**\n   - Zaid saves $6000 each month.\n\n4. **Total Savings Over Time:**\n   - We need to determine how many months it would take for Zaid to save $5100.\n\n5. **Calculating the Number of Months:**\n   - To find the number of months, we divide the remaining amount by the monthly savings: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{5100}{6000} = 0.85 \\text{ months}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Total Time in Months:**\n   - Since Zaid has already been saving for some time, we need to determine how much time has passed.

Therefore, the total amount he would have after saving for 0.85 months would be:\n     \\[\n     5100 + 6000 \\times 0.85 = 5100 + 5100 = 10200\n     \\]\n\nSo, after saving for 0.85 months, Zaid would have a total of $10200."]], "filtered_resps": ["$10200."], "doc_hash": "86540048f589565e3318db6017105cf9b65e5c9d4d5e3af91bbceca3ac3e3a67", "prompt_hash": "79c2b5037cac925219768131e4f174d58d1e7abc0c07e7a176c99d3357f21998", "target_hash": "deeeb5df3f2cee6bf4e597a8a3a878a6ce49b932b9e90b416922d4499f54fae6", "exact_match": 0.0}

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: There are 2 cars in the parking lot, and each car is moving at a speed such that they each stop after 400 meters.\n\n2. **First Car**: The first car stops after traveling 400 meters. This means it takes 400 meters / speed of the car = 400 meters to stop.\n\n3. **Second Car**: The second car stops after traveling 400 meters as well. This means it also takes 400 meters / speed of the car = 400 meters to stop.\n\n4. **Additional Condition**: The problem states that each car stops after traveling 400 meters, and each car stops at a different point. This implies that the cars are stopping at different points along the 400 meters.\n\n5. **Speed Comparison**: The problem also mentions that the second car stops 55 seconds after the first car. This means the second car is traveling faster than the first car.\n\n6. **Speed Calculation**: If the first car takes 400 meters / speed to stop, and the second car takes 400 meters / (speed - 55 meters/second) to stop, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of first car}} = \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of second car} - 55}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{speed of first car} = \\text{speed of second car} - 55\n   \\]\n\n7. **Stopping Time Calculation**: The time taken to stop is the distance divided by the speed. For the first car:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for first car} = \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of first car}}\n   \\]\n   For the second car:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for second car} = \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of second car} - 55}\n   \\]\n   Given that the second car stops 55 seconds after the first car:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of second car} - 55} = \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of first car}} + 55\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solving the Equation**: Let's denote the speed of the first car as \\( v_1 \\) and the speed of the second car as \\( v_2 \\). From the equation \\( v_1 = v_2 - 55 \\), we substitute into the time equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{v_2 - 55} = \\frac{400}{v_2} + 55\n   \\]\n   Multiplying through by \\( v_2 (v_2 - 55) \\) to clear the denominators:\n   \\[\n   400v_2 = 400(v_2 - 55) + 55v_2(v_2 - 55)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   400v_2 = 400v_2 - 22000 + 55v_2^2 - 3075v_2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0 = 55v_2^2 - 3075v_2 - 22000\n   \\]\n   Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( v_2 = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\):\n   \\[\n   v_2 = \\frac{3075 \\pm \\sqrt{3075^2 + 4 \\cdot 55 \\cdot 22000}}{2 \\cdot 55}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v_2 = \\frac{3075 \\pm \\sqrt{9455625 + 4840000}}{110}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v_2 = \\frac{3075 \\pm \\sqrt{14295625}}{110}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v_2 = \\frac{3075 \\pm 3780}{110}\n   \\]\n   Taking the positive root:\n   \\[\n   v_2 = \\frac{6855}{110} \\approx 62.32 \\text{ meters/second}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( v_1 = 62.32 - 55 = 7.32 \\text{ meters/second} \\).\n\n9. **Stopping Time Comparison**: The time taken by the first car:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for first car} = \\frac{400}{7.32} \\approx 54.93 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n   The time taken by the second car:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for second car} = \\frac{400}{62.32 - 55} = \\frac{400}{7.32} \\approx 54.93 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n10. **Conclusion**: Both cars take approximately 54.93 seconds to stop. Therefore, the time taken by the first car is slightly less than the time taken by the second car.\n\nThus, the first car stops in approximately 54.93 seconds, which is less than the 55 seconds mentioned in the problem. The answer is that the first car stops in fewer seconds than the second car."]], "filtered_resps": ["55"], "doc_hash": "b30d79792fee02cc4fc6b8379f2fa72d327f0f1aa1643aaaf947489e4a12ea12", "prompt_hash": "ec855f0b4b54260cd6344e19605eb57c36d75218784990b4e43d57d1f87b1327", "target_hash": "d4735e3a265e16eee03f59718b9b5d03019c07d8b6c51f90da3a666eec13ab35", "exact_match": 0.0}

Initially, there are 3 cars in the parking lot.\n2. 2 more cars arrive, so the total number of cars becomes 3 + 2 = 5.\n3. The problem states that the 2 new cars (kidimbwi kikubwa) brought 2 more lollipops (mara mbili) than the original 3 cars (kidimbwi kidogo) had.\n\nLet's denote the number of lollipops in the original 3 cars as \\( x \\). Therefore, the 2 new cars brought \\( x + 2 \\) lollipops.\n\nThe total number of lollipops after the new cars arrive is:\n\\[ x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2 \\]\n\nWe know that the total number of cars is now 5, and the total number of lollipops is \\( 2x + 2 \\).\n\n4. The problem then states that after the 2 new cars arrived, the 5 cars now have a total of 2 more lollipops than the original 3 cars. So, the total number of lollipops is:\n\\[ 2x + 2 \\]\n\n5. The original 3 cars had \\( x \\) lollipops, and the 2 new cars brought \\( x + 2 \\) lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops is:\n\\[ x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2 \\]\n\n6. Now, the problem states that the 5 cars now have 2 more lollipops than the original 3 cars. So, the total number of lollipops is:\n\\[ x + 2 + 2 = x + 4 \\]\n\nSince the total number of lollipops is the same in both scenarios, we equate the two expressions:\n\\[ 2x + 2 = x + 4 \\]\n\n7. Solving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 2x + 2 = x + 4 \\]\n\\[ 2x - x = 4 - 2 \\]\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the original 3 cars had 2 lollipops each. Therefore, the 2 new cars brought \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) lollipops.\n\n8. Now, we need to determine how many lollipops are in each car after the new cars arrived:\n- The original 3 cars each have 2 lollipops, so the total for the original 3 cars is \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) lollipops.\n- The 2 new cars each have \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) lollipops, so the total for the 2 new cars is \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) lollipops.\n\n9. Adding these together, the total number of lollipops is:\n\\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \\]\n\n10. Now, we need to determine how many lollipops are in each car:\n- The 5 cars now have 14 lollipops in total.\n- The original 3 cars each have 2 lollipops, so the total for the original 3 cars is 6 lollipops.\n- The 2 new cars each have 4 lollipops, so the total for the 2 new cars is 8 lollipops.\n\nSince the total number of lollipops is 14 and the original 3 cars have 6 lollipops, the 2 new cars must have:\n\\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \\] lollipops.\n\nTherefore, the 2 new cars each have 4 lollipops, and the original 3 cars each have 2 lollipops.\n\nSo, the number of lollipops in the original 3 cars is 2 each, and the number of lollipops in the 2 new cars is 4 each.\n\nThe answer is that the original 3 cars each have 2 lollipops, and the 2 new cars each have 4 lollipops."]], "filtered_resps": ["4"], "doc_hash": "6bf1051bb2a53b896c8454ad2d7f0efeb043eab7504fc199f49aa6b0518388ee", "prompt_hash": "0c1e6d9eee96f011e786aa6e89ceec2f6a574b00bc5562d77e34e953e1cb1eed", "target_hash": "2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3", "exact_match": 0.0}

Jason has 1000 minutes of simu (time) each month.\n2. Each day, he uses 15 minutes of his simu and loses 20% of his remaining simu.\n3. At the end of the month, he uses an additional 300 minutes of simu.\n4. We need to find out how much simu Jason has left at the end of a 30-day month.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much simu Jason uses each day:\n\n- Each day, Jason uses 15 minutes of his simu.\n- At the end of each day, he loses 20% of his remaining simu.\n\nLet's denote the remaining simu at the end of day \\( n \\) as \\( S_n \\).\n\n**Day 1:**\n- Initial simu: 1000 minutes\n- Simu used: 15 minutes\n- Remaining simu: \\( 1000 - 15 = 985 \\) minutes\n- Simu lost: \\( 0.20 \\times 985 = 197 \\) minutes\n- Remaining simu at the end of day 1: \\( 985 - 197 = 788 \\) minutes\n\n**Day 2:**\n- Initial simu: 788 minutes\n- Simu used: 15 minutes\n- Remaining simu: \\( 788 - 15 = 773 \\) minutes\n- Simu lost: \\( 0.20 \\times 773 = 154.6 \\) minutes\n- Remaining simu at the end of day 2: \\( 773 - 154.6 = 618.4 \\) minutes\n\nWe can see that the remaining simu decreases each day by 15 minutes and then by 20% of the remaining simu. This process repeats for 30 days.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can use the fact that the remaining simu after each day can be approximated by a geometric series. However, for a more straightforward approach, we can calculate the remaining simu after 30 days directly.\n\n**General formula for remaining simu after \\( n \\) days:**\n\\[ S_n = S_0 \\times (1 - 0.20)^n - 15n \\]\nwhere \\( S_0 = 1000 \\) and \\( n = 30 \\).\n\n\\[ S_{30} = 1000 \\times (0.80)^{30} - 15 \\times 30 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (0.80)^{30} \\):\n\\[ (0.80)^{30} \\approx 0.0115 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the remaining simu:\n\\[ S_{30} = 1000 \\times 0.0115 - 450 \\]\n\\[ S_{30} = 11.5 - 450 \\]\n\\[ S_{30} = -438.5 \\]\n\nSince the remaining simu cannot be negative, it means Jason has used up all his simu and more by the end of the 30th day.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the 30th day, Jason has **0 minutes** of simu left."]], "filtered_resps": ["0"], "doc_hash": "62d8a28eb9f180f7c4d312c60414dc0c800ab2cba21c8621b137b2b419ab7f2a", "prompt_hash": "3636d7dc3082e892754bc5c7dbdbbee6bebc904df22938daf682fb3aeb702551", "target_hash": "1e472b39b105d349bcd069c4a711b44a2fffb8e274714bb07ecfff69a9a7f67b", "exact_match": 0.0}

However, if we were to assume the tanks could have a fractional number of fish, each tank would have approximately 42.67 fish.\n\nSince the problem asks for the number of fish in each tank if they were equal, the answer would be:\n\nEach tank would have approximately 42.67 fish.\n\nBut if we are to stick strictly to whole numbers, the tanks cannot have an equal number of whole fish."]], "filtered_resps": ["42.67"], "doc_hash": "22caef8f6695cf03bd5e944e11a7f3aaa648b4d81968ca9ac20f78b824b89479", "prompt_hash": "61fa5dd4b88a5878f9c415322252f7e432167f6904a4f1eef123f7b00241eed2", "target_hash": "7902699be42c8a8e46fbbb4501726517e86b22c56a189f7625a6da49081b2451", "exact_match": 0.0}
