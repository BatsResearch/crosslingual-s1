Carla initially has 200 GB of storage.\n2. She can normally use 2 GB every 1 minute.\n3. However, she is at 40% usage, which means she is using 40% of her 200 GB.\n4. 40% of 200 GB is \\( 0.40 \\times 200 = 80 \\) GB.\n5. She needs to free up 80 GB to avoid the storage limit.\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it will take her to free up 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB per minute:\n\n6. To find the time required, we divide the amount of storage she needs to free up by the rate at which she can free it up:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{80 \\text{ GB}}{2 \\text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nAfter 40 minutes, she will have freed up 80 GB, and she will be at 40% usage again. At this point, she will need to free up the remaining 80 GB to avoid the storage limit again.\n\n7.

However, since we only need to find the total number of houses \\( x \\), we can simplify our approach by focusing on the 3/4 of the houses.\n\nThe number of people in the houses with 8 people is:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4}x \\times 8 = 6x \\]\n\nSince the total number of people is 15, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 6x + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}x \\times y\\right) = 15 \\]\n\nBut since we only need to find \\( x \\), and we know that the 3/4 of the houses must fit within the total population of 15, we can solve:\n\\[ 6x = 15 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{15}{6} \\]\n\\[ x = 2.5 \\]\n\nSince the number of houses must be a whole number, and given the context of the problem, it's clear that the remaining 1/4 of the houses must have a number of people that fits the total of 15. Given the setup, the only feasible whole number solution is when the remaining houses have 1 person each (since 15 divided by 3 equals 5, and 5 houses with 1 person each fits the 1/4 of the houses).\n\nSo, the total number of houses \\( x \\) is:\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of houses in the village is 5."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "9224c55b9a28dd67ceb4f8e018dc7e0860642196bbf78442eb222a1ed95004f2", "prompt_hash": "e05fa3b5e9a26ad74678304f91823db6fdbf15df28e8eb77cfebe278aebfb9c9", "target_hash": "624b60c58c9d8bfb6ff1886c2fd605d2adeb6ea4da576068201b6c6958ce93f4", "exact_match": 0.0}

Since each vifurushi costs $2.50, Vincent can buy 1 vifurushi for $2.50.\n\nNext, let's determine how many vifurushi Vincent can buy with $1. Since each vifurushi costs $1, Vincent can buy 1 vifurushi for $1.\n\nVincent wants to buy 18 vifurushi in total. To find out how many sets of 2 vifurushi he can buy with $2.50 and how many sets of 1 vifurushi he can buy with $1, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 2x + y = 18 \\]\n\nWhere \\( x \\) is the number of sets of 2 vifurushi and \\( y \\) is the number of sets of 1 vifurushi. We also know that the total cost must be less than or equal to the amount of money Vincent has, which is not specified in the problem. However, we can still find the possible combinations of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nLet's solve for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ y = 18 - 2x \\]\n\nSince \\( y \\) must be a non-negative integer, \\( 18 - 2x \\geq 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( x \\leq 9 \\). Therefore, \\( x \\) can range from 0 to 9.\n\nNow, let's calculate the corresponding values of \\( y \\) for each \\( x \\):\n\n- If \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = 18 \\)\n- If \\( x = 1 \\), then \\( y = 16 \\)\n- If \\( x = 2 \\), then \\( y = 14 \\)\n- If \\( x = 3 \\), then \\( y = 12 \\)\n- If \\( x = 4 \\), then \\( y = 10 \\)\n- If \\( x = 5 \\), then \\( y = 8 \\)\n- If \\( x = 6 \\), then \\( y = 6 \\)\n- If \\( x = 7 \\), then \\( y = 4 \\)\n- If \\( x = 8 \\), then \\( y = 2 \\)\n- If \\( x = 9 \\), then \\( y = 0 \\)\n\nEach of these combinations will give Vincent 18 vifurushi in total.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: There are 2 cars in the parking lot, and each car is moving at a speed such that they each stop after 400 meters.\n\n2. **First Car**: The first car stops after traveling 400 meters. This means it takes 400 meters / speed of the car = 400 meters to stop.\n\n3. **Second Car**: The second car stops after traveling 400 meters as well. This means it also takes 400 meters / speed of the car = 400 meters to stop.\n\n4. **Additional Condition**: The problem states that each car stops after traveling 400 meters, and each car stops at a different point. This implies that the cars are stopping at different points along the 400 meters.\n\n5. **Speed Comparison**: The problem also mentions that the second car stops 55 seconds after the first car. This means the second car is traveling faster than the first car.\n\n6. **Speed Calculation**: If the first car takes 400 meters / speed to stop, and the second car takes 400 meters / (speed - 55 meters/second) to stop, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of first car}} = \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of second car} - 55}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{speed of first car} = \\text{speed of second car} - 55\n   \\]\n\n7. **Stopping Time Calculation**: The time taken to stop is the distance divided by the speed. Since the distance is the same (400 meters), the time taken is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, the car that stops faster (second car) will take less time to stop.\n\n8. **Comparison of Stopping Times**: The first car takes 400 meters / speed to stop, and the second car takes 400 meters / (speed - 55) to stop. Since speed of the second car is greater than the speed of the first car, the second car will take less time to stop.\n\n9. **Conclusion**: The second car stops in less time than the first car.

The only way to satisfy the total jibini used is if the sandwiches use 4 jibini each (since 2 sandwiches would use 4 jibini, and the omlet uses 2 jibini, making the total \\( 4 + 2 + 4 = 10 \\) jibini).\n\nTherefore, the number of jibini used in the sandwiches is 4.

Toulouse has 2 kondoo.\n2. Charleston has 4 kondoo more than Toulouse.\n3. Seattle has 20 kondoo.\n4. The total number of kondoo in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is the same.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many kondoo Charleston has:\n- Charleston has 4 more kondoo than Toulouse.\n- Since Toulouse has 2 kondoo, Charleston has 2 + 4 = 6 kondoo.\n\nNow, we know the number of kondoo in each city:\n- Toulouse: 2 kondoo\n- Charleston: 6 kondoo\n- Seattle: 20 kondoo\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of kondoo in all three cities:\n- Total = Kondoo in Toulouse + Kondoo in Charleston + Kondoo in Seattle\n- Total = 2 + 6 + 20 = 28 kondoo\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of kondoo in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is the same. We are told that Seattle has 20 kondoo, and we have calculated that the total is 28 kondoo. This means the total number of kondoo in all three cities is 28, and since Seattle has 20, the remaining 8 kondoo must be distributed between Toulouse and Charleston.\n\nSince the total is 28 and Seattle has 20, the remaining 8 kondoo must be the difference between the total and Seattle's count:\n- 28 (total) - 20 (Seattle) = 8 kondoo\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 kondoo."]], "filtered_resps": ["8"], "doc_hash": "e3f41e1d608e86cfa86be0bb3627ec5cbff59be4eb66048f230b04810967930c", "prompt_hash": "9d5663d3ee29f0813c9f396d2a20c4afbe1968160250ed69c439a1824d1182c9", "target_hash": "39bb88f40d3aa2b2fe9dea67be27c74765db0ebb3ff3cf8fb779af6319fa2045", "exact_match": 0.0}

Nina initially has 10 bottles of water.\n2. 2 of these bottles are contaminated with mud.\n3. Nina then adds 15 bottles of nanasi (likely referring to soda or another drink) to the 10 bottles of water, but 2 of these bottles are also contaminated with mud.\n4. Nina realizes she has contaminated bottles and removes 1 bottle of water from the total.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total number of bottles after these steps:\n\n- Initially, Nina has 10 bottles of water.\n- She adds 15 bottles of nanasi, but 2 of these are contaminated, so she has 15 - 2 = 13 bottles of nanasi.\n- Therefore, the total number of bottles before removing any is 10 (water) + 13 (nanasi) = 23 bottles.\n- Nina removes 1 bottle of water, so the total number of bottles now is 23 - 1 = 22 bottles.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many of these 22 bottles are contaminated with mud. We know that 2 bottles of water and 2 bottles of nanasi are contaminated. So, the total number of contaminated bottles is 2 (water) + 2 (nanasi) = 4 bottles.\n\nTherefore, the number of bottles that are not contaminated (which includes both water and nanasi) is 22 - 4 = 18 bottles.\n\nThe answer is 18 bottles."]], "filtered_resps": ["18"], "doc_hash": "cafa4a9ed9f1e4fbf4c5d694dd1b1308303246d7a80b4cd75d5c711df93ec8e3", "prompt_hash": "86c0e323428d66205cf736df84ecdf4266231474b8bc49970fe6754f6d9ed11d", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

Since each vifurushi costs $2.50, Vincent can buy 1 vifurushi for $2.50.\n\nNext, let's determine how many vifurushi Vincent can buy with $1. Since each vifurushi costs $1, Vincent can buy 1 vifurushi for $1.\n\nVincent wants to buy 18 vifurushi in total. To find out how many sets of 2 vifurushi he can buy with $2.50 and how many sets of 1 vifurushi he can buy with $1, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 2x + y = 18 \\]\n\nWhere \\( x \\) is the number of sets of 2 vifurushi and \\( y \\) is the number of sets of 1 vifurushi. We also know that the total cost must be less than or equal to the amount of money Vincent has, which is not specified in the problem.

Therefore, the problem might need re-evaluation.\n\nIf we assume the problem meant to say he gave away 3 more pieces than he originally had and 1/4 of the total pieces he had, the answer would be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{628}\n\\]\n\nBut considering the practical constraints, the problem might need rephrasing."]], "filtered_resps": ["628"], "doc_hash": "ef7bfd34152b9c5ad2fa54a8c59d8c6c1c517b2a71e9b22509c20b5b380afca3", "prompt_hash": "fd338cbb29f0578366a685abec77e0acd26fffdf2f1a3a85a45803beee4aa9e3", "target_hash": "43e8852bef636588d357c96ae642844aa7425d8fb73445cc4f017dbd6f5ab6e3", "exact_match": 0.0}

Akijifanyia ushuru yeye mwenyewe, ataweza kufanya saa 3 chache za kazi yake ya huria, na kupoteza mapato ya $35 kila saa. Mhasibu anamtoza $90. Ataokoa pesa ngapi iwapo atampa mhasibu kazi hiyo?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["First, let's determine how much money Jackie earns in one day.\n\nJackie works 3 shifts per day, and each shift earns her $35. Therefore, her daily earnings are:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ shifts/day} \\times \\$35/\\text{shift} = \\$105/\\text{day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it will take for Jackie to earn $90. We do this by dividing the total amount of money she needs by her daily earnings:\n\\[ \\frac{\\$90}{\\$105/\\text{day}} \\]\n\nTo simplify this, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:\n\\[ \\frac{\\$90 \\div 15}{\\$105 \\div 15} = \\frac{6}{7} \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSince Jackie cannot work a fraction of a day in this context, we need to determine how many full days it will take for her to earn at least $90. We can calculate the earnings for each full day and see when she reaches or exceeds $90.\n\n- After 1 day: \\( \\$105 \\)\n- After 2 days: \\( \\$105 \\times 2 = \\$210 \\)\n\nSince $210 is more than $90, Jackie will have earned $90 after 2 full days of work.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many lollipops she will have eaten in those 2 days. Since she eats 1 lollipop per day, she will have eaten:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ days} \\times 1 \\text{ lollipop/day} = 2 \\text{ lollipops} \\]\n\nJackie started with 0 lollipops (since the question doesn't mention any initial lollipops), so after 2 days, she will have eaten 2 lollipops.\n\nTherefore, the number of lollipops she has eaten is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["2"], "doc_hash": "4a3294ce84dd41b323afab4a7431b660da284f995d608b77e2c2c119d0f8ebc2", "prompt_hash": "a79b038983fc5666b07eab25ae296c707897627478392bc7aa42cdff7b8f3466", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

Since the question doesn't specify the number of days, I'll assume we need to calculate based on a full week (7 days) for the sake of an example.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Days of the week:**\n   - Monday to Saturday: 6 days\n   - Sunday: 1 day\n\n2. **Mail sent on non-Sunday days:**\n   - 6 days * 20 pieces of mail/day = 120 pieces of mail\n\n3. **Mail sent on Sunday:**\n   - 1 day * 10 pieces of mail/day = 10 pieces of mail\n\n4. **Total mail sent in a week:**\n   - 120 pieces of mail (non-Sunday days) + 10 pieces of mail (Sunday) = 130 pieces of mail\n\nSo, if Pancho has been mailing for a full week, he has mailed a total of 130 pieces of mail.

Kwa kutumia maelezo haya, timu iliyo na mbio ya haraka zaidi itashinda kwa sekunde ngapi?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions under which the cars stop. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: There are 2 cars in the parking lot, and each car is moving at a speed such that they each stop after 400 meters.\n\n2. **First Car**: The first car stops after traveling 400 meters. This means it takes 400 meters / speed of the car = 400 meters to stop.\n\n3. **Second Car**: The second car stops after traveling 400 meters as well. This means it also takes 400 meters / speed of the car = 400 meters to stop.\n\n4. **Additional Condition**: The problem states that each car stops after traveling 400 meters, and each car stops at a different point. This implies that the cars are stopping at different points along the 400 meters.\n\n5. **Speed Comparison**: The problem also mentions that the second car stops 55 seconds after the first car. This means the second car is traveling faster than the first car.\n\n6. **Speed Calculation**: If the first car takes 400 meters / speed to stop, and the second car takes 400 meters / (speed - 55 meters/second) to stop, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of first car}} = \\frac{400}{\\text{speed of second car} - 55}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{speed of first car} = \\text{speed of second car} - 55\n   \\]\n\n7. **Stopping Time Calculation**: The time taken to stop is the distance divided by the speed. Since the distance is the same (400 meters), the time taken is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, the car that stops faster (second car) will take less time to stop.\n\n8. **Comparison of Stopping Times**: The first car takes 400 meters / speed to stop, and the second car takes 400 meters / (speed - 55) to stop. Since speed of the second car is greater than the speed of the first car, the second car will take less time to stop.\n\n9. **Conclusion**: The second car stops in less time than the first car. Therefore, the car that stops in 55 seconds (the first car) will stop in more time than the car that stops in 60 seconds (the second car).\n\nThus, the car that stops in 55 seconds (the first car) will stop in more time than the car that stops in 60 seconds (the second car). The car that stops in 60 seconds (the second car) will stop in less time than the car that stops in 55 seconds (the first car).\n\nSo, the car that stops in 55 seconds (the first car) will stop in more time than the car that stops in 60 seconds (the second car). The answer is that the car that stops in 55 seconds will stop in more time than the car that stops in 60 seconds."]], "filtered_resps": ["60"], "doc_hash": "b30d79792fee02cc4fc6b8379f2fa72d327f0f1aa1643aaaf947489e4a12ea12", "prompt_hash": "ec855f0b4b54260cd6344e19605eb57c36d75218784990b4e43d57d1f87b1327", "target_hash": "d4735e3a265e16eee03f59718b9b5d03019c07d8b6c51f90da3a666eec13ab35", "exact_match": 0.0}

The only way to satisfy the total jibini used is if the sandwiches use 4 jibini each (since 2 sandwiches would use 4 jibini, and the omlet uses 2 jibini, making the total \\( 4 + 2 + 4 = 10 \\) jibini).\n\nTherefore, the number of jibini used in the sandwiches is 4.

Huwa anawaruhusu wanafunzi kuondoa alama ya chini zaidi kwenye wastani wa matokeo kila muhula. Ikiwa Brinley ana alama za 89, 71, 92, 100 na 86 kwa mazoezi matano ya kwanza, anahitaji kupata alama ngapi katika zoezi la sita ili awe na wastani wa 93?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["To find the missing score that Brinley needs to achieve a total of 93 in her five scores, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sum the known scores**: Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. Let's add these together:\n   \\[\n   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total needed**: Brinley needs a total of 93 for all five scores.

It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let's recheck the context and the given information.\n\nGiven that the scores are supposed to be positive integers and the total should be 93, let's assume the problem meant to ask for the average score instead of the total score. If the average score is 93, then the total sum of the scores should be:\n\\[\n93 \\times 5 = 465\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the missing score by subtracting the sum of the known scores from 465:\n\\[\n465 - 440 = 25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the missing score that Brinley needs to achieve a total average of 93 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{25}\n\\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["25"], "doc_hash": "0bd1ea79d14b3bb343eacf557e7345c5fed8c6d52ce3e68ae5e8937c13398429", "prompt_hash": "9b110e43792ef2576460c6ff8343132cfdb3e65d06fd5b758752e3a1558ba84d", "target_hash": "29db0c6782dbd5000559ef4d9e953e300e2b479eed26d887ef3f92b921c06a67", "exact_match": 0.0}

Initially, there are 3 cars in the parking lot.\n2. 2 more cars arrive, so the total number of cars becomes 3 + 2 = 5.\n3. The problem states that the 2 new cars increase the number of cars in the parking lot, and the car that was initially smaller now has twice the number of cars in the larger car.\n\nLet's denote the number of cars in the smaller car as \\( x \\) and the number of cars in the larger car as \\( y \\). According to the problem, initially:\n\\[ x + y = 5 \\]\n\nAfter the 2 new cars arrive, the total number of cars becomes 5, and the smaller car now has twice the number of cars as the larger car. So:\n\\[ x + 2 = 2y \\]\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( x + y = 5 \\)\n2. \\( x + 2 = 2y \\)\n\nLet's solve this system of equations step by step.\n\nFirst, solve the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 5 - y \\]\n\nNext, substitute \\( x = 5 - y \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ 5 - y + 2 = 2y \\]\n\\[ 7 - y = 2y \\]\n\\[ 7 = 3y \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{7}{3} \\]\n\nSince \\( y \\) must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a car), let's recheck the problem statement and equations. The problem states that the smaller car now has twice the number of cars in the larger car, and the total number of cars is 5. Given these constraints, let's assume the problem meant the smaller car had 1 car and the larger car had 4 cars initially, and then the 2 new cars made the total 5 cars.\n\nSo, initially:\n- The smaller car had 1 car.\n- The larger car had 4 cars.\n\nAfter the 2 new cars arrive:\n- The smaller car now has \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\) cars.\n- The larger car now has \\( 4 + 2 = 6 \\) cars.\n\nThus, the smaller car now has 3 cars, and the larger car now has 6 cars.\n\nTherefore, the number of cars in the smaller car is 3.

Since Harriet is now 21 and she was 5 initially, the difference has increased by 16 years.\n\n10. **Calculating the Number of Years Since the Initial Age**:\n    - The difference in age between Harriet and Zack is 2 years, and it has increased by 16 years.\n    - Therefore, the number of years since the initial age is:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\text{ years}\n    \\]\n\n11. **Harriet's Initial Age**:\n    - If Harriet is now 21 and the age difference has increased by 16 years over 8 years, her initial age was:\n    \\[\n    21 - 16 = 5\n    \\]\n\n12. **Conclusion**:\n    - The problem states that Harriet's current age is 21, and the number of years since the initial age is 8.
