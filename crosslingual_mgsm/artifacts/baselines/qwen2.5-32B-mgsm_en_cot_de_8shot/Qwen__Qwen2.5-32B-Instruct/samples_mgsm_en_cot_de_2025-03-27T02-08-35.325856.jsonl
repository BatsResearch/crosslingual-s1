Wenn Dana 3 Meilen pro Stunde hüpfen kann, und das ist die Hälfte ihrer Laufgeschwindigkeit, dann kann sie 3 * 2 = 6 Meilen pro Stunde laufen.\n2. Da sie viermal so schnell laufen kann wie gehen, kann sie 6 / 4 = 1.5 Meilen pro Stunde gehen.\n3. In sechs Stunden will sie ein Drittel der Zeit laufen und zwei Drittel der Zeit gehen. Ein Drittel von 6 Stunden ist 6 / 3 = 2 Stunden, und zwei Drittel von 6 Stunden sind 6 * (2/3) = 4 Stunden.\n4. Wenn sie 2 Stunden läuft, läuft sie 2 * 6 = 12 Meilen.\n5.

Der Waschbär hat zwei Drittel der verbleibenden Pommes frites geklaut. Das bedeutet, die 6 Pommes frites, die übrig sind, sind ein Drittel der Pommes frites, die vor dem Waschbären da waren.
