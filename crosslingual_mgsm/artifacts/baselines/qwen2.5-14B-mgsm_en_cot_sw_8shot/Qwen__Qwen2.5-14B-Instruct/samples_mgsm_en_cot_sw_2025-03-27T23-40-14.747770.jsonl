Kwa hiyo, mifano yake ya mabuti ni (99 - 33) / 3 = 66 / 3 = 22. Kwa hiyo, gharama yake ya mabuti ni 3 * 22 = $66 / 2 = $3 * 22 = $66 / 2 = $33 / 1.5 = $22 * 3 = $66 / 2 = $33.\n\nKwa hiyo, gharama yake ya mabuti ni dola 33."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "de3c8e4c7768fb5505ce4b4b5f4cadcb5168994de83a272789edb09b0d26e0a7", "prompt_hash": "39020391101017a978434a4fbaf807d7905e7c3572ad6bc30735ddcd9220813d", "target_hash": "5ef6fdf32513aa7cd11f72beccf132b9224d33f271471fff402742887a171edf", "exact_match": 0.0}

The question translates to: \"Tracy cut her field's fence posts to lengths of 4 feet to fit around the mango trees in the farm. The posts were placed in containers that are 6 inches long.

The length of the fence posts is given in feet (4 feet), but the length of the containers is given in inches (6 inches). We need to convert these measurements to the same unit to solve the problem. Let's assume the question means to ask how many 6-inch sections can be cut from a 4-foot post.\n\n1 foot = 12 inches, so 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.\n\nNow, if each container is 6 inches long, the number of containers that can be cut from a 4-foot post is 48 / 6 = 8 containers.\n\nTherefore, Tracy got 8 containers from each 4-foot fence post.

If one bottle of detergent costs $5, we need to find out the total cost of all the washing supplies.\n\nFirst, we need to find out the cost of the 3 bottles of detergent: 3 bottles * $5 per bottle = $15.\nSince the cost of 3 bottles of detergent and one car is $4, the cost of one car must be $4 - $15, but this doesn't make sense as the cost of a car cannot be negative. This suggests that the cost of one car is not included in the $4 but rather the $4 is the cost of the 3 bottles of detergent alone, which contradicts the given information. However, based on the given information, we can assume that the $4 is the cost of the 3 bottles of detergent and not including the car.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all the washing supplies (3 bottles of detergent) is $15. The answer is $15.\n\nBut, if we consider the cost of the car is included in the $4 (which is not clear from the question), we need to clarify the question. Assuming the $4 is only for the detergent, the cost of the car is not provided and cannot be calculated from the given information. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the most straightforward interpretation is that the $4 is solely for the detergent, making the total cost of the supplies $15."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "e949d2e4057de909d39021d9b803f6ba2087419cf8eb6c115355ed158c5df507", "prompt_hash": "3571f81e2780997fa79e170007cb1be4336120343f0b0acbb4383ed5d22223ae", "target_hash": "1a6562590ef19d1045d06c4055742d38288e9e6dcd71ccde5cee80f1d5a774eb", "exact_match": 0.0}

How much more likely (in percentage) is she to roll a large number by rolling a single die three times rather than rolling two dice twice in an experiment?\"\n\nTo solve this, we need to clarify what \"large number\" means in the context of a six-sided die. Typically, a \"large number\" could be considered as 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume that's the case here.\n\n1. **Probability of rolling a large number with one die:**\n   - There are 3 large numbers (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n   - The probability of rolling a large number with one die is \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Probability of rolling a large number with two dice:**\n   - When rolling two dice, there are \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\) possible outcomes.\n   - To find the probability of rolling at least one large number (4, 5, or 6) with two dice, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event (rolling no large numbers) and subtract it from 1.\n   - The probability of rolling a non-large number (1, 2, or 3) with one die is \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n   - The probability of rolling no large numbers with two dice is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n   - Therefore, the probability of rolling at least one large number with two dice is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\n3. **Probability of rolling a large number three times with one die:**\n   - The probability of rolling a large number three times in a row with one die is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n4. **Probability of rolling a large number at least once in two rolls of two dice:**\n   - The probability of rolling no large numbers in one roll of two dice is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n   - The probability of rolling no large numbers in two rolls of two dice is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{16} \\).\n   - Therefore, the probability of rolling at least one large number in two rolls of two dice is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{15}{16} \\).\n\n5. **Comparing the probabilities:**\n   - The probability of rolling a large number three times with one die is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n   - The probability of rolling a large number at least once in two rolls of two dice is \\( \\frac{15}{16} \\).\n\n6. **Calculating the difference in probability:**\n   - The difference in probability is \\( \\frac{15}{16} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{15}{16} - \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{13}{16} \\).\n\n7. **Converting the difference to a percentage:**\n   - The difference in probability is \\( \\frac{13}{16} \\), which is approximately \\( 0.8125 \\) or \\( 81.25\\% \\).\n\nTherefore, Jerry is approximately 81.25% more likely to roll a large number by rolling two dice twice rather than rolling a single die three times."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "a96036a24334ab31b0f63206157f44be36734cb4dd17967f9b412ba4a30e8234", "prompt_hash": "a40c7f5a6679b4d38685599320d7e64946d31bab3ad4786f5320793d8c0a2c9c", "target_hash": "b7a56873cd771f2c446d369b649430b65a756ba278ff97ec81bb6f55b2e73569", "exact_match": 0.0}

The price of a pencil is $1.20 and the price of an eraser is $0.30. How much would 8 pens cost?\"\n\nTo solve this, we first need to find the price of a pen. According to the problem, the price of a pen (P) plus the price of an eraser (E) is equal to the price of a pencil (Pi) plus the price of a key (K). We know the price of a pencil (Pi) is $1.20 and the price of an eraser (E) is $0.30. We need to find the price of a key (K) to solve for the price of a pen (P).\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide the price of a key (K), but we can assume that the key's price is not needed to find the price of a pen because the question is asking for the price of a pen based on the given information. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the price of a pen:\n\nP + E = Pi + K\n\nSince we are not given the price of the key (K), we can assume that the equation is simplified to just the prices of the pen, pencil, and eraser. Therefore, we can say:\n\nP + E = Pi\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\nP + 0.30 = 1.20\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP = 1.20 - 0.30\nP = 0.90\n\nSo, the price of a pen is $0.90.

The question translates to: \"Tracy cut her field's fence posts to lengths of 4 feet to fit around the mango trees in the farm. The posts were placed in containers that are 6 inches long. How many containers did she get?\"\n\nTo solve this, we need to clarify the question a bit. The length of the fence posts is given in feet (4 feet), but the length of the containers is given in inches (6 inches). We need to convert these measurements to the same unit to solve the problem. Let's assume the question means to ask how many 6-inch sections can be cut from a 4-foot post.\n\n1 foot = 12 inches, so 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.\n\nNow, if each container is 6 inches long, the number of containers that can be cut from a 4-foot post is 48 / 6 = 8 containers.\n\nTherefore, Tracy got 8 containers from each 4-foot fence post. If the question is asking how many containers she got in total and we don't know the number of posts, we can only answer based on the information given for one post, which is 8 containers.

If one bottle of detergent costs $5, we need to find out the total cost of all the washing supplies.\n\nFirst, we need to find out the cost of the 3 bottles of detergent: 3 bottles * $5 per bottle = $15.\nSince the cost of 3 bottles of detergent and one car is $4, the cost of one car must be $4 - $15, but this doesn't make sense as the cost of a car cannot be negative. This suggests that the cost of one car is not included in the $4 but rather the $4 is the cost of the 3 bottles of detergent alone, which contradicts the given information. However, based on the given information, we can assume that the $4 is the cost of the 3 bottles of detergent and not including the car.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all the washing supplies (3 bottles of detergent) is $15. The answer is $15.\n\nBut, if we consider the cost of the car is included in the $4 (which is not clear from the question), we need to clarify the question.

How much more likely (in percentage) is she to roll a large number by rolling a single die three times rather than rolling two dice twice in an experiment?\"\n\nTo solve this, we need to clarify what \"large number\" means in the context of a six-sided die. Typically, a \"large number\" could be considered as 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume that's the case here.\n\n1. **Probability of rolling a large number with one die:**\n   - There are 3 large numbers (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n   - The probability of rolling a large number with one die is \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Probability of rolling a large number with two dice:**\n   - When rolling two dice, there are \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\) possible outcomes.\n   - To find the probability of rolling at least one large number (4, 5, or 6) with two dice, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event (rolling no large numbers) and subtract it from 1.\n   - The probability of rolling a non-large number (1, 2, or 3) with one die is \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n   - The probability of rolling no large numbers with two dice is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n   - Therefore, the probability of rolling at least one large number with two dice is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\n3. **Probability of rolling a large number three times with one die:**\n   - The probability of rolling a large number three times in a row with one die is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n4. **Probability of rolling a large number at least once in two rolls of two dice:**\n   - The probability of rolling no large numbers in one roll of two dice is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n   - The probability of rolling no large numbers in two rolls of two dice is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{16} \\).\n   - Therefore, the probability of rolling at least one large number in two rolls of two dice is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{15}{16} \\).\n\n5. **Comparing the probabilities:**\n   - The probability of rolling a large number three times with one die is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n   - The probability of rolling a large number at least once in two rolls of two dice is \\( \\frac{15}{16} \\).\n\n6. **Calculating the difference in probability:**\n   - The difference in probability is \\( \\frac{15}{16} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{15}{16} - \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{13}{16} \\).\n\n7. **Converting the difference to a percentage:**\n   - The difference in probability is \\( \\frac{13}{16} \\), which is approximately \\( 0.8125 \\) or \\( 81.25\\% \\).\n\nTherefore, Jerry is approximately 81.25% more likely to roll a large number by rolling two dice twice rather than rolling a single die three times."]], "filtered_resps": ["81.25"], "doc_hash": "a96036a24334ab31b0f63206157f44be36734cb4dd17967f9b412ba4a30e8234", "prompt_hash": "a40c7f5a6679b4d38685599320d7e64946d31bab3ad4786f5320793d8c0a2c9c", "target_hash": "b7a56873cd771f2c446d369b649430b65a756ba278ff97ec81bb6f55b2e73569", "exact_match": 0.0}

Kalamu 8 zitakuwa pesa ngapi?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["The question is in Swahili and translates to: \"A pen and the price of an eraser are equal to the price of a pencil and a key. The price of a pencil is $1.20 and the price of an eraser is $0.30. How much would 8 pens cost?\"\n\nTo solve this, we first need to find the price of a pen. According to the problem, the price of a pen (P) plus the price of an eraser (E) is equal to the price of a pencil (Pi) plus the price of a key (K). We know the price of a pencil (Pi) is $1.20 and the price of an eraser (E) is $0.30. We need to find the price of a key (K) to solve for the price of a pen (P).\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide the price of a key (K), but we can assume that the key's price is not needed to find the price of a pen because the question is asking for the price of a pen based on the given information. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the price of a pen:\n\nP + E = Pi + K\n\nSince we are not given the price of the key (K), we can assume that the equation is simplified to just the prices of the pen, pencil, and eraser. Therefore, we can say:\n\nP + E = Pi\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\nP + 0.30 = 1.20\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP = 1.20 - 0.30\nP = 0.90\n\nSo, the price of a pen is $0.90.
