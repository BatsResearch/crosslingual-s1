Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n\nSo, the total distance he runs in a week can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} + x + x = 60 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} + 2x = 60 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{4x}{2} = 60 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5x}{2} = 60 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), multiply both sides by 2:\n\\[ 5x = 120 \\]\n\nThen divide by 5:\n\\[ x = 24 \\]\n\nSo, John runs 24 miles on each of the second and third days.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week.

Let's denote the number of orations he reviews for Editorial A as \\( x \\). Consequently, the number of orations he reviews for Editorial B would be \\( 1000 - x \\).\n\nWe know that Editorial B pays Mark double what Editorial A pays per oration. Editorial A pays 5 cents per oration, so Editorial B pays \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) cents per oration.\n\nGiven that the total number of orations is 1000, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x + (1000 - x) = 1000 \\]\n\nThis equation is already balanced, confirming the total number of orations. Now, we need to calculate the total earnings from both editorials.\n\nEarnings from Editorial A:\n\\[ x \\times 5 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nEarnings from Editorial B:\n\\[ (1000 - x) \\times 10 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nThe total earnings \\( E \\) can be calculated as:\n\\[ E = (x \\times 5) + ((1000 - x) \\times 10) \\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[ E = 5x + 10000 - 10x \\]\n\\[ E = 10000 - 5x \\]\n\nTo find the total earnings, we need to determine \\( x \\). Since the total number of orations is 1000 and the distribution between the two editorials is not specified, we can assume an equal distribution for simplicity (though it's not explicitly stated, this is a common assumption in such problems if not specified otherwise).\n\nIf \\( x = 500 \\) (half of 1000):\n\\[ E = 10000 - 5 \\times 500 \\]\n\\[ E = 10000 - 2500 \\]\n\\[ E = 7500 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mark earns 7500 cents in a week.

She wants to earn enough to cover the $70 cost, and she already has $10 saved.\n- The remaining amount she needs to earn is $70 - $10 = $60.\n- She earns $5 for each time she cares for her neighbor's children, so she needs to care for her neighbor's children $60 / $5 = 12 times.\n\nAdditionally, Sara earns $4 each time she cuts the grass. To find out how many times she needs to cut the grass, we need to know how many times she needs to cut the grass to earn the remaining $60 after caring for her neighbor's children.\n\n- Let's assume she cuts the grass \\( x \\) times.

Si a Melanie le quedan 5 aspiradoras, ¿cuántas tenía al comienzo?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Let's denote the total number of aspiradoras Melanie had initially as \\( x \\).\n\n1. Melanie sold a third of her aspiradoras in the house with the green door. So, she sold \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\) aspiradoras.\n2. She then sold 2 more aspiradoras in the house with the red door.\n3. After that, she sold half of what was left in the house with the orange door.\n\nLet's break down the remaining aspiradoras step by step:\n\n- After selling \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\) in the green house, she has \\( x - \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{2x}{3} \\) left.\n- After selling 2 more in the red house, she has \\( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\) left.\n- She then sold half of the remaining aspiradoras in the orange house, so she sold \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right) \\) in the orange house.\n- After selling this amount, she has \\( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right) \\) left.\n\nWe know that after all these sales, she has 5 aspiradoras left. So we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right) = 5\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation step by step:\n\n1. Distribute the \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in the second term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \\left( \\frac{x}{3} - 1 \\right) = 5\n\\]\n\n2. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \\frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5\n\\]\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5\n\\]\n\n4. Add 1 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\n5. Multiply both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nx = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, Melanie had 18 aspiradoras at the beginning."]], "filtered_resps": ["18"], "doc_hash": "e6125940b469ec248e2f53ac759d69cfc464d18b37e3dd3d220fe40ed233890b", "prompt_hash": "3531e6b489084e306a16e95a76ee1c1726fb5954d04c786bc022f8c7d1354ad3", "target_hash": "4ec9599fc203d176a301536c2e091a19bc852759b255bd6818810a42c5fed14a", "exact_match": 1.0}

He runs for 3 days a week. Let's denote the distance he runs on the second and third days as \\( x \\) miles each.\n\nAccording to the problem, on the first day, he runs for 3 hours and this distance is half of what he runs on the second and third days. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n\nSo, the total distance he runs in a week can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} + x + x = 60 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} + 2x = 60 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{4x}{2} = 60 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5x}{2} = 60 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), multiply both sides by 2:\n\\[ 5x = 120 \\]\n\nThen divide by 5:\n\\[ x = 24 \\]\n\nSo, John runs 24 miles on each of the second and third days.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and 24 miles on the second and third days each. Since the problem does not specify the time he spends running on the second and third days, we assume he runs the same amount of time each day for the second and third days. Let's denote the time he spends running each of the second and third days as \\( t \\) hours.\n\nThe total time spent running in a week is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours (first day)} + 2t \\text{ hours (second day)} + 2t \\text{ hours (third day)} = 3 + 4t \\]\n\nThe total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{3 + 4t \\text{ hours}} \\]\n\nSince the problem does not specify the exact time \\( t \\) for the second and third days, we can only express the speed in terms of \\( t \\). However, if we assume he runs the same amount of time each day for the second and third days, we can simplify the calculation.\n\nIf \\( t = 3 \\) hours (assuming he runs 3 hours each day for the second and third days), then:\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = 3 + 4 \\times 3 = 3 + 12 = 15 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, his average speed is:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{15 \\text{ hours}} = 4 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, John's average running speed is \\( 4 \\) miles per hour."]], "filtered_resps": ["4"], "doc_hash": "fa2b6678d01424d08be57060a760a54b4b75e7dc4f8ff8d541e009c72219c4c9", "prompt_hash": "0ab0d05311a03f4e82a315c89ef2d98f8a2a9042caf4722eef6eb52cb56bacfd", "target_hash": "4a44dc15364204a80fe80e9039455cc1608281820fe2b24f1e5233ade6af1dd5", "exact_match": 0.0}

Since the salary increases by 10% annually, we need to apply this increase for 3 more years.\n\n- New monthly salary after 5 years: $660\n- Increase after 3 more years: 10% of $660 = 0.10 * $660 = $66\n- Salary after 8 years: $660 + $66 = $726\n\nTo find the annual salary, we multiply the final monthly salary by 12:\n\n- Annual salary: $726 * 12 = $8712\n\nTherefore, Sylvie's annual salary after 8 years of service is $8712."]], "filtered_resps": ["$8712."], "doc_hash": "484882704b9eb5b6da977e69d1e66c10f2efbc78f16ae43f0c5e208503b8cec9", "prompt_hash": "e493c879c1fd32417ee1dab628095da1ebc1dd5399791a303a821c35d467e15e", "target_hash": "dc8dca4b0608d397de8e57b2de450322b4ef1c42cfb1e2eab0524fd4ec3ef20e", "exact_match": 0.0}

So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\text{Amy's age} = J + 5 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Amy's age} = J + 2 \\]\n\nSince both expressions represent Amy's age, we can equate them:\n\\[ J + 5 = J + 2 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 5 = 2 \\]\n\nThis contradiction suggests a need to re-evaluate the problem. Given the information about Corey and James, we can directly find Jackson's age by using the relationship between Corey and Amy.\n\nSince Corey is 11 years old and Amy is 2 years older than Jackson, and Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson:\n\\[ \\text{Amy's age} = J + 5 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Amy's age} = J + 2 \\]\n\nGiven Corey's age:\n\\[ \\text{Amy's age} = 11 - 2 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Jackson's age is:\n\\[ J + 5 = 9 \\]\n\\[ J = 9 - 5 \\]\n\\[ J = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jackson is 4 years old."]], "filtered_resps": ["4"], "doc_hash": "ba0936a5ce5dca752e80fd115afdb48d55719f1e66a9ceeb621e95abbc8d8724", "prompt_hash": "6b5a95375e7c893d75e8a8ee05cdf3c57cb6074c22652f7000a76d8192b7942a", "target_hash": "4b227777d4dd1fc61c6f884f48641d02b4d121d3fd328cb08b5531fcacdabf8a", "exact_match": 1.0}

Let's denote the number of orations he reviews for Editorial A as \\( x \\). Consequently, the number of orations he reviews for Editorial B would be \\( 1000 - x \\).\n\nWe know that Editorial B pays Mark double what Editorial A pays per oration. Editorial A pays 5 cents per oration, so Editorial B pays \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) cents per oration.\n\nGiven that the total number of orations is 1000, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x + (1000 - x) = 1000 \\]\n\nThis equation is already balanced, confirming the total number of orations. Now, we need to calculate the total earnings from both editorials.\n\nEarnings from Editorial A:\n\\[ x \\times 5 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nEarnings from Editorial B:\n\\[ (1000 - x) \\times 10 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nThe total earnings \\( E \\) can be calculated as:\n\\[ E = (x \\times 5) + ((1000 - x) \\times 10) \\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[ E = 5x + 10000 - 10x \\]\n\\[ E = 10000 - 5x \\]\n\nTo find the total earnings, we need to determine \\( x \\). Since the total number of orations is 1000 and the distribution between the two editorials is not specified, we can assume an equal distribution for simplicity (though it's not explicitly stated, this is a common assumption in such problems if not specified otherwise).\n\nIf \\( x = 500 \\) (half of 1000):\n\\[ E = 10000 - 5 \\times 500 \\]\n\\[ E = 10000 - 2500 \\]\n\\[ E = 7500 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mark earns 7500 cents in a week.

Sara cuida a los niños de su vecino 4 veces y gana $5 cada vez que los cuida. Sus padres le pagan $4 cada vez que corta el césped. Si Sara ya tenía $10 ahorrados antes de comenzar a cuidar niños, ¿cuántas veces deberá cortar el césped antes de poder comprarse la chaqueta y los zapatos?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:\n\n- The chaqueta costs $30.\n- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the shoes cost $20 * 2 = $40.\n- The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money Sara will earn from her activities:\n\n- She earns $5 for each time she cares for her neighbor's children. She wants to earn enough to cover the $70 cost, and she already has $10 saved.\n- The remaining amount she needs to earn is $70 - $10 = $60.\n- She earns $5 for each time she cares for her neighbor's children, so she needs to care for her neighbor's children $60 / $5 = 12 times.\n\nAdditionally, Sara earns $4 each time she cuts the grass. To find out how many times she needs to cut the grass, we need to know how many times she needs to cut the grass to earn the remaining $60 after caring for her neighbor's children.\n\n- Let's assume she cuts the grass \\( x \\) times. She earns $4 for each time she cuts the grass, so she earns $4 * x from cutting the grass.\n- The total amount she earns from caring for her neighbor's children and cutting the grass should be $60.\n- Therefore, $5 * 12 (times she cares for her neighbor's children) + $4 * x (times she cuts the grass) = $60.\n- Simplifying, $60 + $4 * x = $60.\n- Subtracting $60 from both sides, $4 * x = 0.\n- Therefore, \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nThis means Sara does not need to cut the grass at all to earn the remaining $60 after caring for her neighbor's children. She will earn $60 from caring for her neighbor's children alone.\n\nSo, Sara needs to cut the grass 0 times to be able to afford the chaqueta and the 2 pairs of shoes.
