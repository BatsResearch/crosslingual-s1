Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of a red tie} = \\text{Cost of a blue tie} + 0.5 \\times \\text{Cost of a blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \\times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost for the red ties:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for red ties} = \\text{Number of red ties} \\times \\text{Cost of a red tie} = 10 \\times 60 = 600 \\]\n\nTo find the total amount John spent on all the ties, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Total cost for blue ties} + \\text{Total cost for red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \\]\n\nTherefore, John spent a total of $800 on the ties."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "b985f4c7f6f4d2e3fcc53a21f9c56b5b3e741a58026cc28fce72c25bc5c088be", "prompt_hash": "1cb0eddd81d85f50615329651d522e8702f2608d9a2c25ca2169e59355460c7e", "target_hash": "1a1cf797fabe7f95836fabeca626907c77b3e6c9aff7c2290b396a238c69362e", "exact_match": 0.0}

Therefore, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ pounds} - 7.5 \\text{ pounds} = 7.5 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nEach toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys need to be removed to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide:\n\n\\[ 7.5 \\text{ pounds} \\div \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ pound per toy} = 7.5 \\times 2 = 15 \\text{ toys} \\]\n\nTherefore, Юрайя должен вытащить 15 игрушек.

Since they sold 20 stacans from each gallon and they have 20 stacans from each gallon, they sold:\n\\[ \\text{Total gallons} = \\frac{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon} \\times \\text{Total gallons}}{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon}} = \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nGiven that the revenue from selling one gallon is $10, the total revenue from selling all the gallons is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nNow, we know the total revenue is $25 + \\text{Total cost}, so:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 + \\text{Total cost} \\]\n\nSince they sold 20 stacans from each gallon and they have 20 stacans from each gallon, the total number of gallons sold is:\n\\[ \\text{Total gallons} = \\frac{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon} \\times \\text{Total gallons}}{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon}} = \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nGiven that the revenue from selling one gallon is $10, the total revenue from selling all the gallons is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nSince the total revenue is $25 + \\text{Total cost}, we can solve for the total cost:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 + \\text{Total cost} \\]\n\nTo find the total cost, we need to determine the number of gallons sold. Since they sold 20 stacans from each gallon and they have 20 stacans from each gallon, the total number of gallons sold is:\n\\[ \\text{Total gallons} = \\frac{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon} \\times \\text{Total gallons}}{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon}} = \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nGiven that the revenue from selling one gallon is $10, the total revenue from selling all the gallons is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nSince the total revenue is $25 + \\text{Total cost}, we can solve for the total cost:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 + \\text{Total cost} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients. They use 3 dollars worth of lemons and 2 dollars worth of sugar per gallon. Therefore, the total cost for one gallon is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost per gallon} = 3 + 2 = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince they sold 20 stacans from each gallon and they have 20 stacans from each gallon, the total number of gallons sold is:\n\\[ \\text{Total gallons} = \\frac{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon} \\times \\text{Total gallons}}{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon}} = \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nGiven that the revenue from selling one gallon is $10, the total revenue from selling all the gallons is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nSince the total revenue is $25 + \\text{Total cost}, we can solve for the total cost:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 + \\text{Total cost} \\]\n\nThe total cost of the ingredients is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 5 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nGiven that the total revenue is $25 + \\text{Total cost}, we can solve for the total cost:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 + 5 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for the total gallons:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} - 5 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 \\]\n\\[ 5 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total gallons} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the ingredients is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe amount spent on lemons is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the amount spent on lemons is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "43e6ca17016603c34e82b61f0cc0fca5470c2ef008f01130e3d2278cbf2b7dad", "prompt_hash": "6bb73e413845a2df8509f3f18a493090f4f8f9d50f5ea6393ae24fb3acada5ae", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

Сейчас в большом бассейне в четыре раза больше воды, чем в маленьком бассейне. Сколько сейчас воды в маленьком бассейне?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \\( x \\) gallons. According to the problem, the large pool currently has four times the amount of water in the small pool, so the large pool has \\( 4x \\) gallons of water.\n\nWe know that 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the large pool would have had \\( 4x + 4 \\times 4 = 4x + 16 \\) gallons, and the small pool would have had \\( x + 4 \\times 4 = x + 16 \\) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 4x + 16 = 2(x + 16) \\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation step by step:\n\n1. Expand the right side of the equation:\n   \\[ 4x + 16 = 2x + 32 \\]\n\n2. Subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides to isolate \\( x \\):\n   \\[ 2x + 16 = 32 \\]\n\n3. Subtract 16 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[ 2x = 16 \\]\n\n4. Divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the current amount of water in the small pool is \\( x = 8 \\) gallons.

Since they sold 20 stacans from each gallon and they have 20 stacans from each gallon, they sold:\n\\[ \\text{Total gallons} = \\frac{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon} \\times \\text{Total gallons}}{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon}} = \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nGiven that the revenue from selling one gallon is $10, the total revenue from selling all the gallons is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nNow, we know the total revenue is $25 + \\text{Total cost}, so:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 + \\text{Total cost} \\]\n\nSince they sold 20 stacans from each gallon and they have 20 stacans from each gallon, the total number of gallons sold is:\n\\[ \\text{Total gallons} = \\frac{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon} \\times \\text{Total gallons}}{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon}} = \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nGiven that the revenue from selling one gallon is $10, the total revenue from selling all the gallons is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nSince the total revenue is $25 + \\text{Total cost}, we can solve for the total cost:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 + \\text{Total cost} \\]\n\nTo find the total cost, we need to determine the number of gallons sold. Since they sold 20 stacans from each gallon and they have 20 stacans from each gallon, the total number of gallons sold is:\n\\[ \\text{Total gallons} = \\frac{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon} \\times \\text{Total gallons}}{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon}} = \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nGiven that the revenue from selling one gallon is $10, the total revenue from selling all the gallons is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nSince the total revenue is $25 + \\text{Total cost}, we can solve for the total cost:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 + \\text{Total cost} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients. They use 3 dollars worth of lemons and 2 dollars worth of sugar per gallon. Therefore, the total cost for one gallon is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost per gallon} = 3 + 2 = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince they sold 20 stacans from each gallon and they have 20 stacans from each gallon, the total number of gallons sold is:\n\\[ \\text{Total gallons} = \\frac{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon} \\times \\text{Total gallons}}{20 \\text{ stacans/gallon}} = \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nGiven that the revenue from selling one gallon is $10, the total revenue from selling all the gallons is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nSince the total revenue is $25 + \\text{Total cost}, we can solve for the total cost:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 + \\text{Total cost} \\]\n\nThe total cost of the ingredients is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 5 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nGiven that the total revenue is $25 + \\text{Total cost}, we can solve for the total cost:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 + 5 \\times \\text{Total gallons} \\]\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for the total gallons:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\text{Total gallons} - 5 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 \\]\n\\[ 5 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 25 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total gallons} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the ingredients is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe amount spent on lemons is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \\times \\text{Total gallons} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the amount spent on lemons is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["15"], "doc_hash": "43e6ca17016603c34e82b61f0cc0fca5470c2ef008f01130e3d2278cbf2b7dad", "prompt_hash": "6bb73e413845a2df8509f3f18a493090f4f8f9d50f5ea6393ae24fb3acada5ae", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 1.0}

Сейчас в большом бассейне в четыре раза больше воды, чем в маленьком бассейне. Сколько сейчас воды в маленьком бассейне?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \\( x \\) gallons. According to the problem, the large pool currently has four times the amount of water in the small pool, so the large pool has \\( 4x \\) gallons of water.\n\nWe know that 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the large pool would have had \\( 4x + 4 \\times 4 = 4x + 16 \\) gallons, and the small pool would have had \\( x + 4 \\times 4 = x + 16 \\) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 4x + 16 = 2(x + 16) \\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation step by step:\n\n1. Expand the right side of the equation:\n   \\[ 4x + 16 = 2x + 32 \\]\n\n2. Subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides to isolate \\( x \\):\n   \\[ 2x + 16 = 32 \\]\n\n3. Subtract 16 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[ 2x = 16 \\]\n\n4. Divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the current amount of water in the small pool is \\( x = 8 \\) gallons.
