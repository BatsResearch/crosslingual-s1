Since Samanth is 31 years old and Ramond is 25 years old, and they are 6 years apart in age, we can confirm that Ramond was 19 years old when his son was born (31 - 19 = 12, and 19 - 6 = 13, which is consistent with the 23-year-old son).\n\nTherefore, Ramond's son was born 2 years ago, and Ramond's son is 23 years old now.

Initially, Candice had 80 post-it notes in her purse.\n2. She bought a packet of post-it notes and added these to her purse.\n3. After adding the packet, she had 220 additional post-it notes in her purse.\n4. After putting post-it notes in 23 coffee cups, she had 23 post-it notes left.\n\nLet's denote the number of post-it notes in the packet as \\( x \\).\n\nFrom the information given:\n- Initial post-it notes: 80\n- Post-it notes added from the packet: \\( x \\)\n- Post-it notes put in coffee cups: 220\n- Post-it notes left: 23\n\nThe total number of post-it notes before putting them in the coffee cups can be represented as:\n\\[ 80 + x + 220 = \\text{Total post-it notes before putting in cups} \\]\n\nAfter putting 23 post-it notes in the coffee cups, the total number of post-it notes left is 23. Therefore:\n\\[ 80 + x + 220 - 23 = 23 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[ 80 + x + 220 - 23 = 23 \\]\n\\[ 377 + x - 23 = 23 \\]\n\\[ 354 + x = 23 \\]\n\\[ x = 23 - 354 \\]\n\\[ x = -331 \\]\n\nIt seems there is an inconsistency in the problem setup. Given the numbers provided, it's not possible to have a negative number of post-it notes in the packet. Let's recheck the problem statement and the logical steps.\n\nIf we assume the problem meant to say that after putting 23 post-it notes in the cups, she had 23 left, then the equation should be:\n\\[ 80 + x + 220 - 23 = 23 \\]\n\\[ 377 + x = 23 + 23 \\]\n\\[ 377 + x = 46 \\]\n\\[ x = 46 - 377 \\]\n\\[ x = -331 \\]\n\nGiven the negative result, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement. However, if we assume the problem meant to say she had 23 post-it notes left after putting them in the cups, then the packet must have contained 331 post-it notes.\n\nTherefore, the packet contained 331 post-it notes."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "58992576d26f7075f2db1e7080d4a21196e9f549b40d03080674cbc9149e94cb", "prompt_hash": "463d1bc66fe0a4ac0151b182969f6472e59d596abba7eba38d8a4878e1f07876", "target_hash": "3d3286f7cd19074f04e514b0c6c237e757513fb32820698b790e1dec801d947a", "exact_match": 0.0}

The total distance is 24 feet to the shore and 24 feet back, which is 48 feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the time taken to travel this distance:**\n   - Time = Distance / Speed = 48 feet / 1.5 feet/second = 32 seconds.\n\n4. **Determine the amount of water that entered the boat:**\n   - The boat takes 32 seconds to travel 48 feet.\n   - The boat takes 64 seconds to travel the same distance.\n   - The boat travels 24 feet in 32 seconds, so in 64 seconds, it would travel twice that distance (since 64 seconds is twice 32 seconds).\n   - Therefore, in 64 seconds, the boat travels 2 * 24 feet = 48 feet.\n\n5. **Calculate the amount of water that entered the boat:**\n   - The boat takes 2 * 1.5 feet/second = 3 feet/second to travel 48 feet in 64 seconds.\n   -

Since Samanth is 31 years old and Ramond is 25 years old, and they are 6 years apart in age, we can confirm that Ramond was 19 years old when his son was born (31 - 19 = 12, and 19 - 6 = 13, which is consistent with the 23-year-old son).\n\nTherefore, Ramond's son was born 2 years ago, and Ramond's son is 23 years old now.

Initially, Candice had 80 post-it notes in her purse.\n2. She bought a packet of post-it notes and added these to her purse.\n3. After adding the packet, she had 220 additional post-it notes in her purse.\n4. After putting post-it notes in 23 coffee cups, she had 23 post-it notes left.\n\nLet's denote the number of post-it notes in the packet as \\( x \\).\n\nFrom the information given:\n- Initial post-it notes: 80\n- Post-it notes added from the packet: \\( x \\)\n- Post-it notes put in coffee cups: 220\n- Post-it notes left: 23\n\nThe total number of post-it notes before putting them in the coffee cups can be represented as:\n\\[ 80 + x + 220 = \\text{Total post-it notes before putting in cups} \\]\n\nAfter putting 23 post-it notes in the coffee cups, the total number of post-it notes left is 23. Therefore:\n\\[ 80 + x + 220 - 23 = 23 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[ 80 + x + 220 - 23 = 23 \\]\n\\[ 377 + x - 23 = 23 \\]\n\\[ 354 + x = 23 \\]\n\\[ x = 23 - 354 \\]\n\\[ x = -331 \\]\n\nIt seems there is an inconsistency in the problem setup. Given the numbers provided, it's not possible to have a negative number of post-it notes in the packet. Let's recheck the problem statement and the logical steps.\n\nIf we assume the problem meant to say that after putting 23 post-it notes in the cups, she had 23 left, then the equation should be:\n\\[ 80 + x + 220 - 23 = 23 \\]\n\\[ 377 + x = 23 + 23 \\]\n\\[ 377 + x = 46 \\]\n\\[ x = 46 - 377 \\]\n\\[ x = -331 \\]\n\nGiven the negative result, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement. However, if we assume the problem meant to say she had 23 post-it notes left after putting them in the cups, then the packet must have contained 331 post-it notes.\n\nTherefore, the packet contained 331 post-it notes."]], "filtered_resps": ["331"], "doc_hash": "58992576d26f7075f2db1e7080d4a21196e9f549b40d03080674cbc9149e94cb", "prompt_hash": "463d1bc66fe0a4ac0151b182969f6472e59d596abba7eba38d8a4878e1f07876", "target_hash": "3d3286f7cd19074f04e514b0c6c237e757513fb32820698b790e1dec801d947a", "exact_match": 0.0}

The total distance is 24 feet to the shore and 24 feet back, which is 48 feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the time taken to travel this distance:**\n   - Time = Distance / Speed = 48 feet / 1.5 feet/second = 32 seconds.\n\n4. **Determine the amount of water that entered the boat:**\n   - The boat takes 32 seconds to travel 48 feet.\n   - The boat takes 64 seconds to travel the same distance.\n   - The boat travels 24 feet in 32 seconds, so in 64 seconds, it would travel twice that distance (since 64 seconds is twice 32 seconds).\n   - Therefore, in 64 seconds, the boat travels 2 * 24 feet = 48 feet.\n\n5. **Calculate the amount of water that entered the boat:**\n   - The boat takes 2 * 1.5 feet/second = 3 feet/second to travel 48 feet in 64 seconds.\n   -
