This suggests that the selling price is actually 150% more than the original cost price, not the selling price being less than the cost price.\n\n4. **Calculating the Selling Price as 150% More than the Cost Price**:\n   - Let the original cost price be \\( C \\).\n   - The selling price is \\( C + 1.5C = 2.5C \\).\n   - Given that the selling price is $50,000, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     2.5C = 50,000\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( C \\):\n     \\[\n     C = \\frac{50,000}{2.5} = 20,000\n     \\]\n\n5. **Revising the Cost Price**:\n   - The original cost price was $20,000, not $80,000.

Since Samanth is 31 years old and Ramond is 25 years old, and they are 6 years apart in age, we can confirm that Ramond was 19 years old when his son was born (31 - 19 = 12, and 19 - 6 = 13, which is consistent with the 2 years difference).\n\nTherefore, Ramond's son was born 2 years ago, and Ramond's son is 23 years old now.

The key information is:\n\n1. Without the blue sapphire, the javelin can be thrown 400 feet.\n2. With the blue sapphire, the javelin can be thrown 1200 feet (which is three times the distance without the sapphire).\n\nThe dragon's fire breath extends 1000 feet above its head. Therefore, the dragon's fire breath covers a cylindrical area with a radius of 500 feet (since 1000 feet is half the diameter).\n\nTo hit the dragon with the javelin, the javelin must be thrown far enough so that the point of impact is within the 500-foot radius of the dragon's fire breath. \n\nGiven that with the blue sapphire, the javelin can be thrown 1200 feet, we need to determine how much farther this is than the 400 feet without the sapphire.\n\nThe difference in distance is:\n1200 feet - 400 feet = 800 feet\n\nThis means that with the blue sapphire, the javelin can be thrown 800 feet farther than without it. Since the dragon's fire breath is 1000 feet above the ground, the additional 800 feet means the javelin can be thrown 800 feet above the dragon's fire breath.\n\nTherefore, the javelin can be thrown 800 feet above the dragon's fire breath, which means it can be thrown 800 feet away from the dragon's head horizontally.\n\nSo, if the dragon's fire breath extends 1000 feet above its head, and the javelin can be thrown 800 feet above this point, the javelin can be thrown 200 feet away from the dragon's head horizontally.\n\nThe answer is: 200 feet."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "eb86ea8ec11ee5d929cef3a2d29f2c7fd382d7c823bfde16bc9f1e102e0e5712", "prompt_hash": "f8380a2bba41c9075a98098c51181538ab9824d7f7df8af982d150f17a4401d6", "target_hash": "27badc983df1780b60c2b3fa9d3a19a00e46aac798451f0febdca52920faaddf", "exact_match": 0.0}

She drove 100 miles and then needed to refill the tank with 4 gallons of gas.\n\nThis means that the 4 gallons of gas she used to drive 100 miles is equivalent to the difference between a full tank and the current tank level.\n\n3. The difference between a full tank and the current tank level is 12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons.\n4. Therefore, 8 gallons of gas allow the car to travel 100 miles.\n\nTo find out how many miles she can travel on one gallon of gas, we divide the 100 miles by the 8 gallons:\n\n5. 100 miles ÷ 8 gallons = 12.5 miles per gallon.\n\nNow that we know the car's fuel efficiency is 12.5 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far Sofia can travel with a full tank of gas:\n\n6. 12 gallons × 12.5 miles per gallon = 150 miles.\n\nTherefore, Sofia's car can travel 150 miles on a full tank of gas."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "483d6d067949adc91a68daf899b1e4e786a1466633238bccab3405fe07c94973", "prompt_hash": "c57527bfd248d317995927796ed00c05a782088c964947134f128cbf32478ee0", "target_hash": "983bd614bb5afece5ab3b6023f71147cd7b6bc2314f9d27af7422541c6558389", "exact_match": 0.0}

However, the question also mentions mixing these ingredients with water to make coffee, which doesn't align with the 7:13 ratio mentioned. \n\nGiven the 7:13 ratio, it appears the question might be asking about the ratio of tea, cardamom, and cardamom seeds to water, not the total mixture. Let's assume the question is asking for the amount of tea, cardamom, and cardamom seeds used in the mixture.\n\nLet's denote:\n- Tea as \\( T \\)\n- Cardamom as \\( C \\)\n- Cardamom seeds as \\( S \\)\n- Water as \\( W \\)\n\nThe ratio given is \\( T:C:S:W = 7:13:13:1 \\) (since the ratio of cardamom and cardamom seeds is the same).\n\nThe total parts of the ratio are \\( 7 + 13 + 13 + 1 = 34 \\).\n\nIf the total mixture is 120 parts, then:\n- Tea \\( T = \\frac{7}{34} \\times 120 \\)\n- Cardamom \\( C = \\frac{13}{34} \\times 120 \\)\n- Cardamom seeds \\( S = \\frac{13}{34} \\times 120 \\)\n- Water \\( W = \\frac{1}{34} \\times 120 \\)\n\nNow, let's calculate each:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{7}{34} \\times 120 = \\frac{840}{34} = 24.70588235 \\approx 24.71 \\]\n\\[ C = \\frac{13}{34} \\times 120 = \\frac{1560}{34} = 45.88235294 \\approx 45.88 \\]\n\\[ S = \\frac{13}{34} \\times 120 = \\frac{1560}{34} = 45.88235294 \\approx 45.88 \\]\n\\[ W = \\frac{1}{34} \\times 120 = \\frac{120}{34} = 3.52941176 \\approx 3.53 \\]\n\nSo, Catī used approximately 24.71 parts of tea, 45.88 parts of cardamom, and 45.88 parts of cardamom seeds."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "667203cd42e4ca4d70ee0b0054f3b7167069243b5ecbf3e88716a91fe2e99205", "prompt_hash": "840d4c145c4b3e5b48b1f12f05071d761ebae6239111bd4dfd818220e4412b6b", "target_hash": "73475cb40a568e8da8a045ced110137e159f890ac4da883b6b17dc651b3a8049", "exact_match": 0.0}

This suggests that the selling price is actually 150% more than the original cost price, not the selling price being less than the cost price.\n\n4. **Calculating the Selling Price as 150% More than the Cost Price**:\n   - Let the original cost price be \\( C \\).\n   - The selling price is \\( C + 1.5C = 2.5C \\).\n   - Given that the selling price is $50,000, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     2.5C = 50,000\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( C \\):\n     \\[\n     C = \\frac{50,000}{2.5} = 20,000\n     \\]\n\n5. **Revising the Cost Price**:\n   - The original cost price was $20,000, not $80,000.

The key information is:\n\n1. Without the blue sapphire, the javelin can be thrown 400 feet.\n2. With the blue sapphire, the javelin can be thrown 1200 feet (which is three times the distance without the sapphire).\n\nThe dragon's fire breath extends 1000 feet above its head. Therefore, the dragon's fire breath covers a cylindrical area with a radius of 500 feet (since 1000 feet is half the diameter).\n\nTo hit the dragon with the javelin, the javelin must be thrown far enough so that the point of impact is within the 500-foot radius of the dragon's fire breath. \n\nGiven that with the blue sapphire, the javelin can be thrown 1200 feet, we need to determine how much farther this is than the 400 feet without the sapphire.\n\nThe difference in distance is:\n1200 feet - 400 feet = 800 feet\n\nThis means that with the blue sapphire, the javelin can be thrown 800 feet farther than without it. Since the dragon's fire breath is 1000 feet above the ground, the additional 800 feet means the javelin can be thrown 800 feet above the dragon's fire breath.\n\nTherefore, the javelin can be thrown 800 feet above the dragon's fire breath, which means it can be thrown 800 feet away from the dragon's head horizontally.\n\nSo, if the dragon's fire breath extends 1000 feet above its head, and the javelin can be thrown 800 feet above this point, the javelin can be thrown 200 feet away from the dragon's head horizontally.\n\nThe answer is: 200 feet."]], "filtered_resps": ["200"], "doc_hash": "eb86ea8ec11ee5d929cef3a2d29f2c7fd382d7c823bfde16bc9f1e102e0e5712", "prompt_hash": "f8380a2bba41c9075a98098c51181538ab9824d7f7df8af982d150f17a4401d6", "target_hash": "27badc983df1780b60c2b3fa9d3a19a00e46aac798451f0febdca52920faaddf", "exact_match": 1.0}

Since the small tank is empty, the current amount of water in the small tank is 0 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the current amount of water in the small tank is \\(\\boxed{0}\\) gallons."]], "filtered_resps": ["0"], "doc_hash": "2ad2c7d39e876369e78638459c0f05072ecfb89a2ff628f8c645e5755d8c28b3", "prompt_hash": "d156a06acf30a3666c13288e2124b4cb2e1c14664a8c5031cc19f577ed1739f6", "target_hash": "2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3", "exact_match": 0.0}
