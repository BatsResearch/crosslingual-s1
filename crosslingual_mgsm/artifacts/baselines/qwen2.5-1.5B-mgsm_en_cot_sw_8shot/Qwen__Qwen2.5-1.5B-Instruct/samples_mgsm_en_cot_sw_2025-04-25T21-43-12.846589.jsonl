The sum of these fractions should equal 1 (or 100%) because they represent all the skiers.\n\nLet's denote the total number of skiers as S.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n2/5 S + 2/3 S = S\n\nTo solve for S, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 15 in this case. So we rewrite the equation as:\n(2/5 * 3/3)S + (2/3 * 5/5)S = S\n(6/15)S + (10/15)S = S\n\nNow we can combine the fractions:\n(6/15 + 10/15)S = S\n(16/15)S = S\n\nTo solve for S, we divide both sides by 16/15:\nS = S / (16/15)\nS = S * (15/16)\n\nNow, we can cancel out S from both sides:\n1 = 15/16\n\nThis equation is true, which means our fractions are correct. However, we need to find the total number of skiers, not just the fraction. Since the fractions represent the skiers, we can multiply the total number of skiers by the fraction to find the number of new skiers:\n\nTotal number of skiers = 15/16 * S\n\nBut we know that the total number of skiers is 200 (as given in the problem), so we can set up the equation:\n\n200 = 15/16 * S\n\nNow, we solve for S:\n\nS = 200 * (16/15)\nS = 200 * 16 / 15\nS = 3200 / 15\nS = 213.33\n\nSince the number of skiers must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 213.\n\nSo, the total number of skiers in the skying club is 213."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "8aaf782d8c2c0ab336db0e040ff5fc5a45d965fe186c2f5b341ab0b60945beb7", "prompt_hash": "24af3705a5cbcf6e3a6e330336cead32d093b4c51074e0b7f0cafc85185ceb52", "target_hash": "d59eced1ded07f84c145592f65bdf854358e009c5cd705f5215bf18697fed103", "exact_match": 0.0}

The sum of these fractions should equal 1 (or 100%) because they represent all the skiers.\n\nLet's denote the total number of skiers as S.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n2/5 S + 2/3 S = S\n\nTo solve for S, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 15 in this case. So we rewrite the equation as:\n(2/5 * 3/3)S + (2/3 * 5/5)S = S\n(6/15)S + (10/15)S = S\n\nNow we can combine the fractions:\n(6/15 + 10/15)S = S\n(16/15)S = S\n\nTo solve for S, we divide both sides by 16/15:\nS = S / (16/15)\nS = S * (15/16)\n\nNow, we can cancel out S from both sides:\n1 = 15/16\n\nThis equation is true, which means our fractions are correct. However, we need to find the total number of skiers, not just the fraction. Since the fractions represent the skiers, we can multiply the total number of skiers by the fraction to find the number of new skiers:\n\nTotal number of skiers = 15/16 * S\n\nBut we know that the total number of skiers is 200 (as given in the problem), so we can set up the equation:\n\n200 = 15/16 * S\n\nNow, we solve for S:\n\nS = 200 * (16/15)\nS = 200 * 16 / 15\nS = 3200 / 15\nS = 213.33\n\nSince the number of skiers must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 213.\n\nSo, the total number of skiers in the skying club is 213."]], "filtered_resps": ["213."], "doc_hash": "8aaf782d8c2c0ab336db0e040ff5fc5a45d965fe186c2f5b341ab0b60945beb7", "prompt_hash": "24af3705a5cbcf6e3a6e330336cead32d093b4c51074e0b7f0cafc85185ceb52", "target_hash": "d59eced1ded07f84c145592f65bdf854358e009c5cd705f5215bf18697fed103", "exact_match": 0.0}

Nyumba ya kila mteja itahitaji chupa 2 za klorini na kifurushi kimoja cha vitambaa vya kupangusa. Chupa za klorini ni $2 kwa kila moja na vifurushi vya vitambaa vitagharimu $5 kila kimoja. Hizi ndizo gharama zake pekee za matumizi. Anapiga hesabu kuwa jumla ya mapato yake kwa wiki itakuwa $92.
