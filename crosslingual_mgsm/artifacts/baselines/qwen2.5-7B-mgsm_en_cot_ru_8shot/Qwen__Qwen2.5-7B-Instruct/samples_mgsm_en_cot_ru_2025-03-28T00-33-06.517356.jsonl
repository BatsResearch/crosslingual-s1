The answer is 5.\n\nQuestion: Джеки пытается решить, заниматься ли ей налогами самостоятельно или нанять бухгалтера. Если она будет заниматься налогами самостоятельно, она сможет работать на фрилансе на 3 часа меньше и будет терять 35 $ в час в виде упущенного дохода. Бухгалтер берет 90 $ в час. Сколько денег она получит дополнительно, если наймет бухгалтера?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["让我们逐步分析这个问题。\n\n1. **计算自行处理税务的损失**：\n   - 如果Jackie自行处理税务，她将减少3小时的自由职业工作时间。\n   - 每小时她会损失35美元的收入。\n   - 因此，自行处理税务的总损失为：3小时 × 35美元/小时 = 105美元。\n\n2. **计算请会计师的费用**：\n   - 会计师每小时收费90美元。\n   - 由于Jackie需要处理的税务工作相当于3小时的工作量，因此会计师的总费用为：3小时 × 90美元/小时 = 270美元。\n\n3. **比较两种情况的净收益**：\n   - 自行处理税务的净损失为105美元。\n   - 请会计师的总费用为270美元。\n   - 因此，如果Jackie请会计师，她将额外损失的金额为：270美元 - 105美元 = 165美元。\n\n所以，Jackie如果请会计师处理税务，她将额外损失165美元。换句话说，她不会得到额外的钱，反而会损失165美元。如果Jackie希望节省开支，她可能选择自行处理税务。"]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "40dbca96ea3ac9e57b030a3c4f70897e52fc46c0e690c6a67f366ee75fffd782", "prompt_hash": "bfa8ff89609c365223f0598781515f1301af2c327375ec4907fce7fa8d538878", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

We know that John has 54 candies.\n2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2: \\(54 \\div 2 = 27\\). So, Robert has 27 candies.\n3. James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to the number of candies Robert has: \\(27 + 6 = 33\\). So, James has 33 candies.\n4. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: \\(54 - 33 = 21\\).\n\nSo, John has 21 more candies than James.

The answer is 5.\n\nQuestion: Бринли учится в математическом классе мистера Берта. Мистер Берт проводит по шесть контрольных работ в каждом семестре. Он разрешает студентам убрать самую низкую оценку при расчете средней оценки за каждый семестр. Если за первые пять контрольных работ Бринли получила оценки 89, 71, 92, 100 и 86, какая оценка ей нужна за шестую контрольную работу, чтобы получить среднюю оценку 93?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["为了解决这个问题，我们首先需要计算出在去掉最低分后，剩下的五个分数的总和需要达到多少，才能使平均分达到93。\n\n1. 首先，找出前五个分数中的最低分。分数分别是89, 71, 92, 100, 86。最低分是71。\n2. 去掉最低分后，剩下四个分数的总和需要达到的总和是：\\(93 \\times 4 = 372\\)。\n3. 现在，我们需要计算去掉最低分后的前五个分数的总和：\\(89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367\\)。\n4. 为了使去掉最低分后的总和达到372，第六个分数需要是：\\(372 - 367 = 5\\)。\n\n但是，这里有一个逻辑上的小错误。实际上，我们需要计算的是去掉最低分后的五个分数的总和达到372，而当前四个分数的总和是367，所以第六个分数应该是：\\(372 - 367 = 5\\)，但这显然是不合理的，因为分数通常不会这么低。\n\n正确的计算应该是：去掉最低分71后，剩下四个分数的总和需要是372，而当前四个分数的总和是367，所以第六个分数应该是：\\(372 - (367 - 71) = 372 - 296 = 76\\)。\n\n所以，为了使平均分达到93，Brinley在第六次测试中需要得到76分。"]], "filtered_resps": ["76"], "doc_hash": "d115f47bcbdcaa476549b95e4998c2bdfd976b724a9524cffda6d23bec85600f", "prompt_hash": "14cae83b7b3cce2abc0b80ebe402d43d56353d88807c84505003af12bd8aa09e", "target_hash": "29db0c6782dbd5000559ef4d9e953e300e2b479eed26d887ef3f92b921c06a67", "exact_match": 0.0}

Обувь стоит 320,00 $, а пояс - 32,00 $. Итого общая стоимость покупки составляет 320,00 + 32,00 = 352,00 $.\n\nТеперь нужно определить, сколько часов Лори должна работать, чтобы заработать 352,00 $. Она получает 8,00 $ в час. Для этого нужно разделить общую сумму покупки на сумму, которую она зарабатывает за час: 352,00 / 8,00 = 44.\n\nТаким образом, Лори нужно будет работать 44 часа, чтобы заработать足够的信息：让我们逐步解答这个问题。\n\n首先，我们需要计算总花费：\n- 鞋子的价格是 320.00 美元\n- 腰带的价格是 32.00 美元\n- 总花费 = 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 美元\n\n接下来，我们需要计算Lori需要工作多少小时才能赚到352.00美元：\n- 每小时工资是 8.00 美元\n- 需要工作的小时数 = 总花费 / 每小时工资 = 352.00 / 8.00 = 44 小时\n\n所以，Lori需要工作44小时才能赚到足够的钱来购买鞋子和腰带。"]], "filtered_resps": ["44"], "doc_hash": "0bfb9875e513bc8ebb9c6e854aff89ca15c1982e46882c6a9abd1f7f4374cca6", "prompt_hash": "7d61e9deff5d5464a844dafa4d93b600b36cf92767b18ee5b75279ae729512fa", "target_hash": "71ee45a3c0db9a9865f7313dd3372cf60dca6479d46261f3542eb9346e4a04d6", "exact_match": 1.0}
