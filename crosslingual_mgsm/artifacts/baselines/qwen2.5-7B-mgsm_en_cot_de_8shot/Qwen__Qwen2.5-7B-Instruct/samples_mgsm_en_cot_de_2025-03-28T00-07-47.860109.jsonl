Die Ratten werden in 3 Käfigen in gleich großen Gruppen gehalten und jeder Ratte 6 Strohhalme gegeben. Es gibt 10 Käfige von Hamstern, die allein gehalten werden, und jedem Hamster werden 5 Strohhalme gegeben. Es gibt auch einen Hasenstall, in dem 20 Strohhalme unter den Hasen verteilt werden. Überall sonst in dem Laden wird kein Stroh verteilt. Wenn 160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteil wurden, wie viele Ratten sind dann in jedem Käfig?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["为了解决这个问题，我们首先需要根据给定的信息计算出所有小啮齿动物（包括老鼠和仓鼠）总共收到了多少根稻草，然后根据这些信息来确定每只老鼠所在的笼子中有多少只老鼠。\n\n1. **计算给定的稻草总数**：\n   - 每只老鼠收到了6根稻草，总共有160根稻草被分发给了小啮齿动物。\n   - 仓鼠每只收到了5根稻草，但这里没有给出仓鼠总共收到了多少根稻草，所以我们先不考虑仓鼠，只考虑老鼠。\n\n2. **计算老鼠收到的稻草总数**：\n   - 160根稻草全部分给了老鼠。\n   - 每只老鼠6根稻草，所以老鼠的总数 = 160 / 6 = 26.666...，但老鼠的数量必须是整数，所以这里可能存在信息不完整或理解错误。不过，根据题目的设定，我们假设这里给出的160根稻草全部是给老鼠的。\n\n3. **计算每只老鼠所在的笼子数量**：\n   - 有3个笼子，每只老鼠所在的笼子中有相同数量的老鼠。\n   - 所以，每只笼子中的老鼠数量 = 26 / 3 = 8.666...，同样，老鼠的数量必须是整数，所以这里可能需要重新审视题目条件。\n\n根据题目条件，如果160根稻草全部分给了老鼠，且每只老鼠6根，那么实际上应该有26只老鼠，但因为笼子数是3，所以每笼老鼠数应该是26除以3的结果，即每笼8只，余数2，意味着需要调整笼子数或稻草分配以确保每笼数量相同。\n\n综上所述，如果严格按照题目条件，每笼应该有8只老鼠，但因为总数26不能被3整除，所以实际操作中可能需要调整笼子数或稻草分配，以确保每笼数量相同。但基于题目给定的条件，每笼应该有8只老鼠，余下的2只可以单独处理或分配到其他地方。"]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "11f4b1fcf0485119648fc90f328dcadd0207fb534e5a2b3506e4db6286fc5154", "prompt_hash": "60750dc71f9b44dd5fae2494d93aae3e3a668f9b72417156adc098ee1c44f19d", "target_hash": "ef2d127de37b942baad06145e54b0c619a1f22327b2ebbcfbec78f5564afe39d", "exact_match": 0.0}
