Le bateau a commencé à prendre deux litres d'eau tous les dix pieds ramés en direction de la rive. Il lui a fallu seize secondes pour parcourir vingt pieds. La rive étant à 64 secondes, combien le bateau avait-il pris d'eau quand Julia a atteint la rive ?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["D'abord, déterminons combien de pieds Julia a parcouru en 64 secondes.

Donc, en 64 secondes, elle parcourt 20 pieds * 4 = 80 pieds.\n\nMaintenant, sachant que le bateau prend 2 litres d'eau tous les 10 pieds, nous pouvons calculer combien d'eau il a pris en 80 pieds. Pour 80 pieds, le nombre de fois que 10 pieds rentre dans 80 pieds est 80 / 10 = 8.

Comme nous voulons savoir le prix après 36 mois, nous devons d'abord calculer combien de fois le prix va augmenter.\n\n1. Calculer le nombre d'augmentations de prix :\n   - 36 mois divisés par 2 mois par augmentation = 18 augmentations.\n\n2. Calculer le nouveau prix après chaque augmentation :\n   - Le prix initial est de 20 $.\n   - Une augmentation de 20% signifie que le nouveau prix est de 120% du prix précédent.\n\n3. Appliquer l'augmentation 18 fois :\n   - Nouveau prix = prix précédent * 1.20 (pourcentage de 120%)\n   - Pour 18 augmentations, nous pouvons utiliser la formule : nouveau prix = prix initial * (1.20)^nombre d'augmentations\n   - Donc, le nouveau prix = 20 * (1.20)^18\n\n4. Calculer le nouveau prix :\n   - Utilisons une calculatrice pour calculer (1.20)^18, ce qui donne environ 35.83.\n   - Multiplions ce résultat par le prix initial de 20 $ : 20 * 35.83 = 716.60 $.\n\nLe prix d'un sac de billes après 36 mois sera d'environ 716.60 $."]], "filtered_resps": ["$."], "doc_hash": "db56d5689556fc79a04bb2ea3fc5a4d455f42fa1ded8fccfd52e0e99a02cec7a", "prompt_hash": "dff8b8ef5382b27ca715cf81580c38d8a051866c87b52960588e6618fbcea61b", "target_hash": "8241649609f88ccd2a0a5b233a07a538ec313ff6adf695aa44a969dbca39f67d", "exact_match": 0.0}
