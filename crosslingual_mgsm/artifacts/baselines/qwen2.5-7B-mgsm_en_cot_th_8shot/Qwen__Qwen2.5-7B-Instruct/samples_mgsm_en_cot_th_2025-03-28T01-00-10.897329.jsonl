Calculate the area of the Beatrix's dried fruit sheets:\n   - Beatrix's dried fruit sheets have a width of 24 and a length of 14.\n   - Area = width × length = 24 × 14 = 336 square units.\n\n2. Calculate the area of the Marcelle's dried fruit sheets:\n   - Marcelle's dried fruit sheets have a width of 3 and a length of 24.\n   - Area = width × length = 3 × 24 = 72 square units.\n\n3. Calculate the total area of the dried fruit sheets:\n   - Total area = Beatrix's area + Marcelle's area = 336 + 72 = 408 square units.\n\n4. Since both Marcelle and Beatrix eat all the dried fruit sheets, they eat a total of 408 square units of dried fruit.\n\n5. To find out how much they eat on average, we need to know how many people are sharing the fruit. In this case, it's 2 people (Marcelle and Beatrix).\n\n6. Divide the total area by the number of people:\n   - Average area per person = Total area / Number of people = 408 / 2 = 204 square units.\n\nTherefore, on average, Marcelle and Beatrix each eat 204 square units of dried fruit."]], "filtered_resps": ["204"], "doc_hash": "f4cb20f17ff681f0feeb9e09f412bac6c209984c1bb64307dc873d72610dc213", "prompt_hash": "c7463291a7937b92e79790872d7ab121445a0dc90f91efd4203e0fd2ea4969c5", "target_hash": "811786ad1ae74adfdd20dd0372abaaebc6246e343aebd01da0bfc4c02bf0106c", "exact_match": 0.0}

= 28）是两个鱼缸里鱼的数量差值的两倍。因此，我们可以这样设置方程：\n\n\\[28 = 2(x - x)\\]\n\n这个方程也是不正确的，因为x - x = 0。正确的理解应该是海龟数量的差值是鱼数量差值的两倍，而鱼的数量是相等的，所以差值为0。正确的方程应该是：\n\n\\[28 =
