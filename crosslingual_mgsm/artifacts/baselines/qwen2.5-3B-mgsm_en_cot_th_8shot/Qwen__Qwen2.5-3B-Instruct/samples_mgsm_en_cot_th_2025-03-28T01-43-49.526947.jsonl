The remaining cars are semi-automatic.\n\nNumber of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)\nNumber of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)\nNumber of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16\nNumber of semi-automatic cars = 4\n\nNow, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:\n\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "d1c5a40363a12074abec1539949239df0d943a2279d3a1da9c2043d42e2f4ab5", "prompt_hash": "a7341d623384d67569d8a2cd185257d355c200f7128a2f2539ff67a599db51fd", "target_hash": "f5ca38f748a1d6eaf726b8a42fb575c3c71f1864a8143301782de13da2d9202b", "exact_match": 0.0}

Let's denote the number of white carnations ordered by Sandra as \\( x \\).\n\n2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered red roses 4 times the number of white carnations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red roses} = 4x\n   \\]\n\n3. Sandra also ordered pink lilies, which were 200 more than the number of white carnations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pink lilies} = x + 200\n   \\]\n\n4. We know the total number of white carnations ordered is \\( x \\).\n\n5. The total number of flowers ordered by Sandra is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink lilies:\n   \\[\n   4x + x + (x + 200) = 6x + 200\n   \\]\n\n6. The problem states that Sandra originally had 20 lollipops, but this information is not relevant to the flower count.\n\n7. Since the problem does not provide the total number of flowers ordered, we need to focus on the red roses. We know that the red roses are 4 times the number of white carnations, and the pink lilies are 200 more than the white carnations.\n\n8. To find the number of red roses, we need to determine \\( x \\). However, the problem does not give us the total number of flowers, so we focus on the red roses alone.\n\n9. Given that Sandra is demanding the red roses to be delivered by 17:00, and we know the relationship between the red roses and white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses based on the information provided.\n\n10. Since the problem does not specify the exact total number of flowers, we can infer that the number of red roses must be sufficient to meet the demand. Given the relationship \\( 4x \\), and without the total number, we focus on the red roses.\n\n11. The number of red roses is 4 times the number of white carnations. Since the pink lilies are 200 more than the white carnations, and the total number of flowers is not specified, we can assume the red roses are the primary focus.\n\n12. Therefore, the number of red roses Sandra ordered is:\n   \\[\n   4x\n   \\]\n\nSince the problem does not provide the exact value of \\( x \\), we can conclude that the number of red roses Sandra ordered is \\( 4x \\). Given the context and the demand, the number of red roses must be sufficient to meet the requirement. \n\nThus, the number of red roses Sandra needs to deliver by 17:00 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4x}\n\\]\n\nHowever, without the exact value of \\( x \\), we cannot provide a numerical answer.

Rats (mouse cages) are divided into groups, and each rat gets 6 strands of hay.\n2. There are 10 hamster cages.\n3. Each hamster gets 5 strands of hay.\n4. There are 20 strands of hay given to all the rabbits combined.\n5. A total of 160 strands of hay are given to all the small-toothed animals (rats and rabbits combined).\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of strands of hay given to the hamsters:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hamster cages} \\times 5 \\text{ strands per hamster} = 50 \\text{ strands} \\]\n\nNext, we know the total number of strands given to all small-toothed animals is 160. So, the number of strands given to the rats is:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ strands} - 50 \\text{ strands} = 110 \\text{ strands} \\]\n\nEach rat gets 6 strands of hay, so the number of rats is:\n\\[ \\frac{110 \\text{ strands}}{6 \\text{ strands per rat}} = \\frac{110}{6} \\approx 18.33 \\]\n\nSince the number of rats must be a whole number, and we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to check if 18 or 19 rats fit the total of 160 strands.\n\nIf there are 18 rats:\n\\[ 18 \\text{ rats} \\times 6 \\text{ strands per rat} = 108 \\text{ strands} \\]\n\nIf there are 19 rats:\n\\[ 19 \\text{ rats} \\times 6 \\text{ strands per rat} = 114 \\text{ strands} \\]\n\nSince 114 strands is closer to 110 strands and fits the total, we can conclude that there are 19 rats.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many rats are in each of the 3 cages. Since the rats are divided into 3 equal groups:\n\\[ \\frac{19 \\text{ rats}}{3 \\text{ cages}} = 6 \\text{ rats per cage with 1 rat left over} \\]\n\nSince the problem states that the rats are divided into groups, and we have 19 rats in total, we can conclude that each of the 3 cages has 6 rats, and there is 1 rat left over.\n\nTherefore, each of the 3 cages has 6 rats."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "e055fd43523840a212ffbf11fd573fc0e8b48a0d22247ccd5b0b8b4a7407ce77", "prompt_hash": "5de65c59a2be1e3aa244960ace140b89171bf501181aeeedb437287d502a1aea", "target_hash": "ef2d127de37b942baad06145e54b0c619a1f22327b2ebbcfbec78f5564afe39d", "exact_match": 0.0}

The dragon can breathe fire that reaches 1000 feet.\n2. Pauli's golden spear can reach 400 feet before the fire reaches it.\n3. When Pauli holds a sapphire pendant, she can throw the golden spear 3 times farther than usual.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how far Pauli can throw the golden spear when she holds the sapphire pendant. Since the usual range is 400 feet and it can be thrown 3 times farther, the new range is:\n\n\\[ 400 \\text{ feet} \\times 3 = 1200 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nHowever, the dragon's fire can only reach 1000 feet. Therefore, the effective range Pauli can throw the golden spear is limited by the dragon's fire range.\n\nSince the dragon's fire can reach 1000 feet, Pauli can throw the golden spear up to 1000 feet before the fire reaches it.\n\nThus, if Pauli holds the sapphire pendant, she can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still throw the golden spear to it.

Since the tank was half empty (12 gallons total - 4 gallons used = 8 gallons remaining), we can calculate the fuel used for 100 miles as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Fuel used for 100 miles} = 12 \\text{ gallons} - 8 \\text{ gallons} = 4 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) for the 4 gallons used:\n\n\\[ \\text{Miles per gallon} = \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ gallons}} = 25 \\text{ miles per gallon} \\]\n\nSince the tank holds 12 gallons and she can drive 25 miles per gallon, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total distance on full tank} = 12 \\text{ gallons} \\times 25 \\text{ miles per gallon} = 300 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Sofia will be able to drive 300 miles on one full tank of fuel."]], "filtered_resps": ["300"], "doc_hash": "a86bf70118e213416f049945837de785affe85c911ee91577c0431e24a3ac98e", "prompt_hash": "013e4fd1f5ee64a61b94a0f19c3a3125b07e5d4a364fc6c93beaa1224af550aa", "target_hash": "983bd614bb5afece5ab3b6023f71147cd7b6bc2314f9d27af7422541c6558389", "exact_match": 1.0}

Since we can't have half a piece, we'll assume it eats 7 pieces and leaves 8 pieces.\n\n4. **Roosters Attack:**\n   - Three roosters each eat 3 pieces, so they eat a total of 3 * 3 = 9 pieces.\n   - After the roosters eat, 8 - 9 = -1 pieces, which is not possible. This indicates an error in the assumption that the nightingale left 8 pieces. Let's re-evaluate the nightingale's consumption.\n\n   - If the nightingale eats 7 pieces, it leaves 8 pieces.\n   - The roosters eat 9 pieces, leaving 8 - 9 = -1, which is incorrect. Let's assume the nightingale eats 8 pieces, leaving 7 pieces.\n\n5. **Rabbit Steals:**\n   - A rabbit steals 2/3 of the remaining 7 pieces, which is 2/3 * 7 = 4.67 pieces. Since we can't have a fraction of a piece, we'll assume it steals 4 pieces, leaving 3 pieces.\n\n6. **Moldy Mites:**\n   - The mites eat the last 2 pieces, leaving 3 - 2 = 1 piece.\n\nSo, the initial pack contained 15 pieces, and after all the events, 1 piece remains.\n\nThe answer is: **15 pieces**."]], "filtered_resps": ["15"], "doc_hash": "d7df890aa4bac0fcaa5694c786b612dd5ccd115a52e2a91dc66db3ac136e8480", "prompt_hash": "cee09e6dfcdabe6db2ad8ebec40fe638325e4ea4fb47d002202c8f121e09abd7", "target_hash": "98010bd9270f9b100b6214a21754fd33bdc8d41b2bc9f9dd16ff54d3c34ffd71", "exact_match": 0.0}

The price after each increase can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Price} = \\text{Old Price} \\times (1 + \\text{Increase Rate})\n   \\]\n   where the increase rate is 20%, or 0.20.\n\n5. **Calculating the Price After Each Increase**:\n   - After the 1st increase: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Price} = 20 \\times (1 + 0.20) = 20 \\times 1.20 = 24\n     \\]\n   - After the 2nd increase: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Price} = 24 \\times 1.20 = 28.80\n     \\]\n   - After the 3rd increase: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Price} = 28.80 \\times 1.20 = 34.56\n     \\]\n   - Continue this process until the 18th increase.\n\n6. **General Formula for the Price After 18 Increases**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Price} = 20 \\times (1.20)^{18}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculating the Final Price**:\n   - First, calculate \\(1.20^{18}\\):\n     \\[\n     1.20^{18} \\approx 10.48\n     \\]\n   - Then, multiply by the initial price:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Final Price} = 20 \\times 10.48 = 209.60\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of one bag of glass after 36 months will be approximately $209.60."]], "filtered_resps": ["$209.60."], "doc_hash": "75cd2ebf19e0361d1a4be8c6fd254e72a6cde9e537c934b7271149bb97a2d30a", "prompt_hash": "e69470ca1527a746ad3a59a29dcba34275230344e3b0cd4e25f3fb2e24a1abe0", "target_hash": "8241649609f88ccd2a0a5b233a07a538ec313ff6adf695aa44a969dbca39f67d", "exact_match": 0.0}

Let's denote the number of white carnations ordered by Sandra as \\( x \\).\n\n2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered red roses 4 times the number of white carnations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red roses} = 4x\n   \\]\n\n3. Sandra also ordered pink lilies, which were 200 more than the number of white carnations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pink lilies} = x + 200\n   \\]\n\n4. We know the total number of white carnations ordered is \\( x \\).\n\n5. The total number of flowers ordered by Sandra is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink lilies:\n   \\[\n   4x + x + (x + 200) = 6x + 200\n   \\]\n\n6. The problem states that Sandra originally had 20 lollipops, but this information is not relevant to the flower count.\n\n7. Since the problem does not provide the total number of flowers ordered, we need to focus on the red roses. We know that the red roses are 4 times the number of white carnations, and the pink lilies are 200 more than the white carnations.\n\n8. To find the number of red roses, we need to determine \\( x \\). However, the problem does not give us the total number of flowers, so we focus on the red roses alone.\n\n9. Given that Sandra is demanding the red roses to be delivered by 17:00, and we know the relationship between the red roses and white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses based on the information provided.\n\n10. Since the problem does not specify the exact total number of flowers, we can infer that the number of red roses must be sufficient to meet the demand. Given the relationship \\( 4x \\), and without the total number, we focus on the red roses.\n\n11. The number of red roses is 4 times the number of white carnations. Since the pink lilies are 200 more than the white carnations, and the total number of flowers is not specified, we can assume the red roses are the primary focus.\n\n12. Therefore, the number of red roses Sandra ordered is:\n   \\[\n   4x\n   \\]\n\nSince the problem does not provide the exact value of \\( x \\), we can conclude that the number of red roses Sandra ordered is \\( 4x \\). Given the context and the demand, the number of red roses must be sufficient to meet the requirement. \n\nThus, the number of red roses Sandra needs to deliver by 17:00 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4x}\n\\]\n\nHowever, without the exact value of \\( x \\), we cannot provide a numerical answer. If we assume the simplest case where \\( x = 50 \\) (a reasonable assumption given the context), then the number of red roses would be:\n\\[\n4 \\times 50 = 200\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of red roses Sandra needs to deliver is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["200"], "doc_hash": "50b0b964705ec47e216efb49f4e883c8a36665b5efd016878b8a3705fb18e6a4", "prompt_hash": "ec5a7db572b24a4b86f0c0efee2d5a03f5328c24ee9b0307e075549d846259cf", "target_hash": "a512db2741cd20693e4b16f19891e72b9ff12cead72761fc5e92d2aaf34740c1", "exact_match": 0.0}

There are 20 strands of hay given to all the rabbits combined.\n5. A total of 160 strands of hay are given to all the small-toothed animals (rats and rabbits combined).\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of strands of hay given to the hamsters:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hamster cages} \\times 5 \\text{ strands per hamster} = 50 \\text{ strands} \\]\n\nNext, we know the total number of strands given to all small-toothed animals is 160.
