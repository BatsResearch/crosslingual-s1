This can be verified as follows:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\]\nHowever, the problem states that only 30 letters need to be stamped, which seems to be a discrepancy. Let's assume the problem meant to say that 30 letters are one-third of the total letters that need to be stamped, and the total letters that need to be stamped is 90 (since \\( 30 \\times 3 = 90 \\)).\n\nGiven this, let's solve the problem:\n\n1. **Total letters that need to be stamped**: 90 letters.\n2. **Letters already stamped**: 30 letters.\n3. **Letters that need to be stamped**: 90 - 30 = 60 letters.\n\nThe problem states that these 60 letters are one-third of the total letters that need to be stamped. This is consistent with our calculation.\n\nNow, let's find out how many letters were in the stamped pile initially.

Let's denote the number of white carnations ordered by Sandra as \\( x \\).\n\n2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered red roses 4 times the number of white carnations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red roses} = 4x\n   \\]\n\n3. Sandra also ordered pink lilies, which were 200 more than the number of white carnations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pink lilies} = x + 200\n   \\]\n\n4. We know the total number of white carnations ordered is \\( x \\).\n\n5. The total number of flowers ordered by Sandra is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink lilies:\n   \\[\n   4x + x + (x + 200) = 6x + 200\n   \\]\n\n6. The problem states that Sandra originally ordered these flowers, and she has 12 flowers left after some were not delivered. Therefore, the number of flowers delivered is:\n   \\[\n   6x + 200 - 12 = 6x + 188\n   \\]\n\n7. Since the number of flowers delivered must be equal to the number of flowers ordered, we have:\n   \\[\n   6x + 188 = 6x + 200 - 12\n   \\]\n\n8. Simplifying the equation, we find:\n   \\[\n   6x + 188 = 6x + 196 - 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6x + 188 = 6x + 184\n   \\]\n\n9. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   188 = 184\n   \\]\n\n10. This indicates that the number of flowers delivered is indeed \\( 6x + 188 \\).\n\n11. To find the number of red roses delivered, we need to determine \\( x \\). Since the total number of flowers delivered is 12 less than the total ordered, and the pink lilies are 200 more than the white carnations, we can set up the equation:\n    \\[\n    6x + 188 = 12\n    \\]\n\n12. Solving for \\( x \\):\n    \\[\n    6x = 12 - 188\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    6x = -176\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x = -\\frac{176}{6}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x = -29.33\n    \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the total number of flowers delivered is 12, and the pink lilies are 200 more than the white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses delivered is:\n\n\\[\n4x = 4 \\times 12 = 48\n\\]\n\nThus, to meet the deadline, Fred must deliver 48 red roses by 17:00.

Aaron has 2 more pieces of jewelry than Shoban.\n\nFirst, we calculate half of what Raymonde has:\n\\[ \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\n\nSince Aaron has more pieces of jewelry than 20, let's denote the number of pieces of jewelry Aaron has as \\( A \\). According to the problem, \\( A > 20 \\).\n\nNext, we know that Aaron has 2 more pieces of jewelry than Shoban. Let's denote the number of pieces of jewelry Shoban has as \\( S \\). Therefore:\n\\[ A = S + 2 \\]\n\nSince \\( A > 20 \\), we can substitute \\( A \\) with \\( S + 2 \\):\n\\[ S + 2 > 20 \\]\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides to solve for \\( S \\):\n\\[ S > 18 \\]\n\nSo, Shoban has more than 18 pieces of jewelry. Since \\( S \\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \\( S \\) is 19.\n\nTo verify, if Shoban has 19 pieces of jewelry:\n\\[ A = S + 2 = 19 + 2 = 21 \\]\n\nThis satisfies the condition that \\( A > 20 \\).\n\nTherefore, Shoban has 19 pieces of jewelry.

This can be verified as follows:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\]\nHowever, the problem states that only 30 letters need to be stamped, which seems to be a discrepancy. Let's assume the problem meant to say that 30 letters are one-third of the total letters that need to be stamped, and the total letters that need to be stamped is 90 (since \\( 30 \\times 3 = 90 \\)).\n\nGiven this, let's solve the problem:\n\n1. **Total letters that need to be stamped**: 90 letters.\n2. **Letters already stamped**: 30 letters.\n3. **Letters that need to be stamped**: 90 - 30 = 60 letters.\n\nThe problem states that these 60 letters are one-third of the total letters that need to be stamped. This is consistent with our calculation.\n\nNow, let's find out how many letters were in the stamped pile initially. Since the 30 letters that are already stamped are one-third of the total letters that need to be stamped, the total letters that need to be stamped (90) should be three times the number of letters that are already stamped (30).\n\nTo find the initial number of letters in the stamped pile, we need to consider that the 30 letters that are already stamped are one-third of the total letters that need to be stamped. Therefore, the total letters that need to be stamped (90) should be three times the number of letters that are already stamped (30).\n\nSince the 30 letters that are already stamped are one-third of the total letters that need to be stamped, the total letters that need to be stamped (90) should be three times the number of letters that are already stamped (30).\n\nThus, the initial number of letters in the stamped pile is:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{1/3} = 30 \\times 3 = 90 \\]\n\nHowever, since the problem states that 30 letters are already stamped, and these are one-third of the total letters that need to be stamped, the initial number of letters in the stamped pile must be:\n\\[ 30 \\times 3 = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, the initial number of letters in the stamped pile is:\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]\n\nBut since the problem states that 30 letters are already stamped, and these are one-third of the total letters that need to be stamped, the initial number of letters in the stamped pile must be:\n\\[ 30 \\times 3 = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, the initial number of letters in the stamped pile is:\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["90"], "doc_hash": "c12594dfdbbae97a904dd5b611941e77a68a0e3c776de9b81637a2df3a16b615", "prompt_hash": "90e83c2968d65107531533be8f56d5e6a1371de35ad31e4a35f1fb5b780cf861", "target_hash": "4a44dc15364204a80fe80e9039455cc1608281820fe2b24f1e5233ade6af1dd5", "exact_match": 0.0}

Since we can't have half a piece, we'll assume it eats 7 pieces and leaves 8 pieces.\n\n4. **Roosters Attack:**\n   - Three roosters each eat 3 pieces, so they eat a total of 3 * 3 = 9 pieces.\n   - After the roosters eat, 8 - 9 = -1 pieces, which is not possible. This indicates an error in the assumption that the nightingale left 8 pieces. Let's re-evaluate the situation.\n\n   - If the nightingale leaves 8 pieces, the roosters can't eat 9 pieces. So, let's assume the nightingale leaves 15 - 9 = 6 pieces (since 9 pieces are eaten by the roosters).\n\n5. **Rabbit Steals:**\n   - A rabbit steals 2/3 of the remaining 6 pieces, which is 2/3 * 6 = 4 pieces.\n   - After the rabbit steals, 6 - 4 = 2 pieces remain.\n\n6. **Moldy Mites:**\n   - The mites eat the last 2 pieces, leaving 0 pieces.\n\nSo, initially, the French fry pack contained 15 pieces.

Let's denote the number of white carnations ordered by Sandra as \\( x \\).\n\n2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered red roses 4 times the number of white carnations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red roses} = 4x\n   \\]\n\n3. Sandra also ordered pink lilies, which were 200 more than the number of white carnations:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pink lilies} = x + 200\n   \\]\n\n4. We know the total number of white carnations ordered is \\( x \\).\n\n5. The total number of flowers ordered by Sandra is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink lilies:\n   \\[\n   4x + x + (x + 200) = 6x + 200\n   \\]\n\n6. The problem states that Sandra originally ordered these flowers, and she has 12 flowers left after some were not delivered. Therefore, the number of flowers delivered is:\n   \\[\n   6x + 200 - 12 = 6x + 188\n   \\]\n\n7. Since the number of flowers delivered must be equal to the number of flowers ordered, we have:\n   \\[\n   6x + 188 = 6x + 200 - 12\n   \\]\n\n8. Simplifying the equation, we find:\n   \\[\n   6x + 188 = 6x + 196 - 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6x + 188 = 6x + 184\n   \\]\n\n9. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   188 = 184\n   \\]\n\n10. This indicates that the number of flowers delivered is indeed \\( 6x + 188 \\).\n\n11. To find the number of red roses delivered, we need to determine \\( x \\). Since the total number of flowers delivered is 12 less than the total ordered, and the pink lilies are 200 more than the white carnations, we can set up the equation:\n    \\[\n    6x + 188 = 12\n    \\]\n\n12. Solving for \\( x \\):\n    \\[\n    6x = 12 - 188\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    6x = -176\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x = -\\frac{176}{6}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x = -29.33\n    \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the total number of flowers delivered is 12, and the pink lilies are 200 more than the white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses delivered is:\n\n\\[\n4x = 4 \\times 12 = 48\n\\]\n\nThus, to meet the deadline, Fred must deliver 48 red roses by 17:00.

Since Jean is 2 years older than Mark, and Jan is 30 years old, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mark's current age} = \\text{Jean's current age} - 2 \\]\n\nSince Jean is 2 years older than Mark, and we don't know Mark's current age yet, let's denote Mark's current age as \\( M \\) and Jean's current age as \\( J \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[ J = M + 2 \\]\n\nNext, we know that two years ago, Mark's age was half of Jan's age at that time plus 5 years. Two years ago, Jan was \\( 30 - 2 = 28 \\) years old. So, two years ago, Mark's age was \\( M - 2 \\).

Therefore, she needs to mow the lawn 14 times.\n   - If Sara mows the lawn 14 times, she earns \\( 14 \\times 4 = 56 \\) dollars.\n   - Adding her initial $10, she has \\( 10 + 56 = 66 \\) dollars.\n   - The cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, so she still has \\( 66 - 70 = -4 \\) dollars, which is not possible. Therefore, she needs to mow the lawn 15 times.\n   - If Sara mows the lawn 15 times, she earns \\( 15 \\times 4 = 60 \\) dollars.\n   - Adding her initial $10, she has \\( 10 + 60 = 70 \\) dollars.\n   - The cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, so she has exactly $70, which is enough.\n\nTherefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 15 times to have enough money to buy the jacket and the shoes.
