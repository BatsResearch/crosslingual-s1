The answer is 5.\n\nQuestion: Brinley está en la clase de matemáticas del Sr. Bert. El Sr. Bert toma seis exámenes cada semestre. Les permite a los estudiantes eliminar la nota más baja del promedio de cada semestre. Si las notas de Brinley en los primeros cinco exámenes son 89, 71, 92, 100 y 86, ¿qué nota necesita en el sexto examen para obtener un promedio de 93?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Para que Brinley obtenga un promedio de 93 en seis exámenes, necesita un total de 93 * 6 = 558 puntos. Las notas de los primeros cinco exámenes suman 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 puntos. Si Brinley quiere un promedio de 93, necesita 558 - 438 = 120 puntos en el sexto examen. Sin embargo, dado que la nota máxima en un examen es generalmente 100, Brinley necesitaría obtener la nota máxima en el sexto examen y luego el Sr. Bert eliminaría la nota más baja para poder alcanzar un promedio de 93. Si eliminamos la nota más baja de las primeras cinco notas, la nota que se eliminaría sería 71. Entonces, Brinley necesitaría que la suma de sus cinco mejores notas sea 558 - 71 = 487. Como ya tiene 438 puntos de las cinco notas restantes, necesita 487 - 438 = 49 puntos adicionales en el sexto examen para alcanzar un promedio de 93, pero teniendo en cuenta que la nota más baja se elimina, la nota necesaria en el sexto examen es 100 para asegurar que 71 sea la nota que se elimina.

Primero, calculemos cuánto ganaba Adrien cuatro años después:\n\n40% de $40,000 es 0.40 * $40,000 = $16,000.\n\nEntonces, cuatro años después, Adrien ganaba $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.\n\nDado que los salarios de Adrien y Lylah aumentaron a la par, Lylah también tuvo un aumento del 40% en su salario. Para encontrar el salario de Lylah hace cuatro años, primero necesitamos entender que el salario de Adrien era un 30% más alto que el de Lylah hace cuatro años. Si el salario de Lylah era X, entonces el salario de Adrien era 1.30 * X.\n\nComo Adrien ganaba $40,000 hace cuatro años, podemos establecer la ecuación:\n\n1.30 * X = $40,000\n\nEntonces, X = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (aproximadamente).\n\nCuatro años después, Lylah también tuvo un aumento del 40%, por lo que su salario ahora es:\n\n$30,769.23 * 1.40 = $43,076.92 (aproximadamente).\n\nPor lo tanto, el salario total que Adrien y Lylah recibían cuatro años después es:\n\n$56,000 (Adrien) + $43,076.92 (Lylah) = $99,076.92 (aproximadamente).\n\nLa respuesta es aproximadamente $99,076.92."]], "filtered_resps": ["$99,076.92."], "doc_hash": "5a4402c2a54b333157708edfb92b03ad723cbb94305b961fe8a17ed0c2dd9226", "prompt_hash": "7f94d04da1a2d7c5d32a2f60cfb4d084743dce032c9ec0814b177eef0b958830", "target_hash": "c3dd3155bfb41ce88db8cb3949533694746fe2767aeea3faba904b50baabfca6", "exact_match": 0.0}
