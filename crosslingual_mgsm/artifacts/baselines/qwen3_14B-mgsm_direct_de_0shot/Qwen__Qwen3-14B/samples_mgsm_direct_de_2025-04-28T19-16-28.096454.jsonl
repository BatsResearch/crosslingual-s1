Josh wants to sell his house and figure out his profit. So, he bought the house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on repairs. Then the value of the house increased by 150%. Hmm, I need to calculate his profit here. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total cost he incurred. That would be the original purchase price plus the repair costs. So, $80,000 plus $50,000. Let me add those up: 80k + 50k is $130,000. So his total investment is $130,000.\n\nNow, the house's value increased by 150%. Wait, 150% of what? Is it 150% of the original value or 150% of the total investment? The question says \"der Wert des Hauses steigt um 150%\". In German, \"steigt um 150%\" usually means the value increases by 150% of the original value. So, if the original value was $80,000, then a 150% increase would be 1.5 times the original value. Let me confirm that. \n\nSo, original value is $80,000. A 150% increase would be 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000. So the new value is original value plus 150% of that, which is 80k + 120k = 200,000. Wait, but that seems like a 150% increase. Alternatively, sometimes people might think of percentage increase as the new value being 150% of the original, but that would be a 50% increase. Hmm, this is a common confusion. Let me check.\n\nIf something increases by 100%, it doubles. So 150% increase would be original + 150% of original, which is 2.5 times the original. So original value is $80k, 150% increase would be 80k * 2.5 = 200k. So the new value is $200,000. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"der Wert des Hauses steigt um 150%\". In German, \"um\" can mean \"by\" in the sense of an increase. So, if the value increases by 150%, that would be 150% of the original value added to the original. So yes, 80k + 150% of 80k = 80k + 120k = 200k. So the new value is $200,000.\n\nBut then, Josh's total cost was $130,000 (original 80k + repairs 50k). So his profit would be the selling price minus total cost. If he sells it for $200,000, then profit is 200k - 130k = 70,000. So $70,000 profit. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the 150% increase is on the total investment or the original value. The problem says \"der Wert des Hauses steigt um 150%\". The value of the house, which was originally $80k, so the increase is on the original value. Therefore, the new value is 80k * 2.5 = 200k. \n\nAlternatively, if the 150% was on the total investment, that would be different. But the problem states that the value of the house increases, not the total investment. So the value of the house is the original value plus the repairs? Wait, no. The repairs are part of the cost, but the value of the house is separate. The repairs might have increased the value, but the problem says the value increased by 150% due to the repairs. Wait, the problem says: \"Er kauft ein Haus für 80.000 US-Dollar und steckt anschließend 50.000 US-Dollar an Reparaturen hinein. Dadurch steigt der Wert des Hauses um 150%.\" So the repairs caused the value to increase by 150%. So the original value was 80k, then after repairs, the value is 80k + 150% of 80k = 200k. \n\nBut another way to think: maybe the 150% is the total increase from the original value. So the new value is 80k * (1 + 1.5) = 200k. So that's the same as before. \n\nTherefore, selling price is 200k. Total cost is 80k (purchase) + 50k (repairs) = 130k. Profit is 200k - 130k = 70k. So $70,000 profit. \n\nBut wait, sometimes when people talk about percentage increases, they might mean the new value is 150% of the original. But that would be a 50% increase. However, the wording here is \"steigt um 150%\", which in German is \"increases by 150%\", which is an absolute increase of 150% of the original value. So that would be 80k + 150% of 80k = 200k. \n\nAlternatively, if the value increased to 150% of the original, that would be 1.5 * 80k = 120k, which is a 50% increase. But the problem says \"steigt um 150%\", which is \"increases by 150%\", so the former interpretation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the profit is $70,000. \n\nBut let me check again.

James wants to know how many meters he runs in a week. The problem says he does 3 short-distance runs three times a week. Each short-distance run is 60 meters. Hmm, wait, let me parse that again.\n\nSo, he runs 3 times a week, and each time he does 3 short-distance runs. Each of those short runs is 60 meters. So, first, maybe I need to figure out how many runs he does in a week. If he does 3 runs per week, and each of those runs consists of 3 short-distance runs, then total runs per week would be 3 times 3? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers here.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"James beschließt, 3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe zu absolvieren.\" Translating that: James decides to do 3 short-distance runs three times a week. So, \"3-mal pro Woche\" means three times a week. Each time he does 3 short-distance runs. So each session is 3 runs, and he does that three times a week. So total number of runs per week is 3 (times per week) multiplied by 3 (runs per session). That would be 9 runs in total per week.\n\nBut wait, maybe the original German is a bit different. Let me check again. \"3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe zu absolvieren.\" So \"3-mal pro Woche\" is three times a week, and each time he does 3 Kurzstreckenläufe. So each session is 3 runs, and he does that three times a week. So total runs per week: 3 times 3 = 9 runs.\n\nEach run is 60 meters. So total meters per week would be 9 runs * 60 meters per run. Let me calculate that. 9 * 60. Well, 10*60 is 600, minus 1*60 is 540. So 540 meters in total per week.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the original question. Let me check again. The user wrote: \"James beschließt, 3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe zu absolvieren. Pro Kurzstreckenlauf läuft er 60 Meter. Wie viele Meter insgesamt läuft er pro Woche?\"\n\nSo, \"3-mal pro Woche\" is three times a week. Each time he does 3 Kurzstreckenläufe. Each Kurzstreckenlauf is 60 meters. So per week, he does 3 times (3 runs) = 9 runs. Each run is 60 meters. So 9 * 60 = 540 meters. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is that he does 3 short-distance runs each week, and each run is 60 meters.

James wants to know how many meters he runs in a week. The problem says he does 3 short-distance runs three times a week. Each short-distance run is 60 meters. Hmm, wait, let me parse that again.\n\nSo, he runs 3 times a week, and each time he does 3 short-distance runs. Each of those short runs is 60 meters. So, first, maybe I need to figure out how many runs he does in a week. If he does 3 runs per week, and each of those runs consists of 3 short-distance runs, then total runs per week would be 3 times 3? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers here.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"James beschließt, 3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe zu absolvieren.\" Translating that: James decides to do 3 short-distance runs three times a week. So, \"3-mal pro Woche\" means three times a week. Each time he does 3 short-distance runs. So each session is 3 runs, and he does that three times a week. So total number of runs per week is 3 (times per week) multiplied by 3 (runs per session). That would be 9 runs in total per week.\n\nBut wait, maybe the original German is a bit different. Let me check again. \"3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe zu absolvieren.\" So \"3-mal pro Woche\" is three times a week, and each time he does 3 Kurzstreckenläufe. So each session is 3 runs, and he does that three times a week. So total runs per week: 3 times 3 = 9 runs.\n\nEach run is 60 meters. So total meters per week would be 9 runs * 60 meters per run. Let me calculate that. 9 * 60. Well, 10*60 is 600, minus 1*60 is 540. So 540 meters in total per week.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the original question. Let me check again. The user wrote: \"James beschließt, 3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe zu absolvieren. Pro Kurzstreckenlauf läuft er 60 Meter. Wie viele Meter insgesamt läuft er pro Woche?\"\n\nSo, \"3-mal pro Woche\" is three times a week. Each time he does 3 Kurzstreckenläufe. Each Kurzstreckenlauf is 60 meters. So per week, he does 3 times (3 runs) = 9 runs. Each run is 60 meters. So 9 * 60 = 540 meters. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is that he does 3 short-distance runs each week, and each run is 60 meters. But the original says \"3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe\", which is three times a week, each time doing 3 runs. So yeah, 3 times 3 is 9 runs. So 9 * 60 = 540. That's the answer.\n</think>\n\nJames läuft 3-mal pro Woche, und jedes Mal absolviert er 3 Kurzstreckenläufe.

Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally, her download speed is 2 GB per minute. But after 40% of the download is done, Windows forces a restart for updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then she has to restart the download from the beginning. I need to figure out the total time it takes for her to download the file.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem into parts. The download is interrupted after 40%, then there's a 20-minute restart, and then she has to start over. Wait, does that mean she has to download the entire 200 GB again after the restart? Or does she continue from where she left off? The question says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which translates to \"start over from the beginning again.\" So, after the restart, she has to download the entire 200 GB again. That seems a bit harsh, but okay.\n\nSo, the process is: first, she downloads 40% of 200 GB, then the system restarts for 20 minutes, then she starts over and downloads the entire 200 GB again. Wait, but that would mean she ends up with two copies of the file? Or maybe the first 40% is lost, and she has to download the whole thing again? The problem says \"den Download noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which might mean that after the restart, the download is restarted from the beginning, so the first 40% is not saved. Therefore, she has to download the entire 200 GB twice? But that seems like a lot. Let me check the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"nachdem 40 % des Downloads abgeschlossen sind, erzwingt Windows einen Neustart, um Updates zu installieren, was 20 Minuten dauert. Danach muss Carla den Download noch einmal ganz neu starten.\" So after 40% is done, the restart happens, and then she has to restart the download from the beginning. So, the first 40% is already downloaded, but then the restart happens, and then she has to start over. Wait, but if the download was interrupted, maybe the downloaded 40% is lost? Or does she continue from there? The problem says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which is \"start over again from the beginning.\" So, she has to download the entire 200 GB again, even though she had already downloaded 40% before the restart. That seems like a lot, but maybe that's how it is.\n\nSo, the total time would be the time to download 40% plus the 20 minutes for the restart, plus the time to download 100% again. Wait, but that would be 40% + 100% = 140% of the file. But maybe the first 40% is already done, and then after the restart, she has to download the entire 200 GB again. But that would mean she ends up with two copies? Or maybe the first 40% is not saved, so she has to download the whole thing again. The problem is a bit ambiguous here, but given the wording, I think it's the latter: after the restart, she has to start the download from the beginning, so the first 40% is lost, and she has to download the entire 200 GB again. Therefore, the total time is the time to download 40% (which is 40% of 200 GB) plus 20 minutes for the restart, plus the time to download 200 GB again.\n\nWait, but that would be 40% of 200 GB, which is 80 GB, then 20 minutes, then another 200 GB. So total data downloaded is 80 + 200 = 280 GB, but the actual file is 200 GB. But maybe the question is just about the time, not the data. So, the time would be:\n\nTime for first 40%: (0.4 * 200 GB) / 2 GB per minute = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.\n\nThen 20 minutes for the restart.\n\nThen time for the full download again: 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.\n\nBut wait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after the restart, she doesn't have to download the entire 200 GB again, but just the remaining 60%? But the problem says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which is \"start over from the beginning again.\" So, that would imply that she has to start the download from the beginning, meaning the entire 200 GB again. Therefore, the total time is indeed 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.\n\nBut let me think again. If the download was interrupted at 40%, and then after the restart, she has to start over, but maybe the download is resumed from where it left off? But the problem says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which is \"start over again from the beginning,\" so that would mean she has to download the entire file again, not resuming. Therefore, the total time is as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 40% is already downloaded, and after the restart, she continues from there. But the problem says she has to restart the download from the beginning, so that would mean she has to download the entire 200 GB again, even though she had already downloaded 40% before. That seems inefficient, but maybe that's the case.\n\nSo, the answer would be 40 minutes (for the first 40%) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (full download) = 160 minutes. Therefore, 160 minutes total.\n\nBut let me check if there's another interpretation. Suppose that after the restart, she can continue the download from where it left off. Then the total time would be 40 minutes (for 40%) + 20 minutes (restart) + time to download remaining 60% (which is 0.6*200 / 2 = 60 minutes). Total time: 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes. But the problem says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which is \"start over again from the beginning,\" so that would imply that she has to start the download from the beginning, not resuming. Therefore, the first interpretation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 160 minutes.\n</think>\n\nCarla muss die Datei in zwei Phasen herunterladen, da der Download nach 40 % unterbrochen wird und anschließend neu gestartet werden muss. \n\n1. **Erster Teil des Downloads (40 %):**  \n   - Größe: $ 40\\% \\times 200\\, \\text{GB} = 80\\, \\text{GB} $  \n   - Zeit: $ \\frac{80\\, \\text{GB}}{2\\, \\text{GB/Minute}} = 40\\, \\text{Minuten} $\n\n2. **Windows-Update (20 Minuten):**  \n   - Zeit: $ 20\\, \\text{Minuten} $\n\n3. **Neuer Download (vollständig):**  \n   - Größe: $ 200\\, \\text{GB} $  \n   - Zeit: $ \\frac{200\\, \\text{GB}}{2\\, \\text{GB/Minute}} = 100\\, \\text{Minuten} $\n\n**Gesamte Zeit:**  \n$ 40\\, \\text{Minuten} + 20\\, \\text{Minuten} + 100\\, \\text{Minuten} = 160\\, \\text{Minuten} $\n\n**Antwort:**  \nDas Herunterladen der Datei dauert insgesamt **160 Minuten**."]], "filtered_resps": ["<think>\nOkay, let's see. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally, her download speed is 2 GB per minute. But after 40% of the download is done, Windows forces a restart for updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then she has to restart the download from the beginning. I need to figure out the total time it takes for her to download the file.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem into parts. The download is interrupted after 40%, then there's a 20-minute restart, and then she has to start over. Wait, does that mean she has to download the entire 200 GB again after the restart? Or does she continue from where she left off? The question says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which translates to \"start over from the beginning again.\" So, after the restart, she has to download the entire 200 GB again. That seems a bit harsh, but okay.\n\nSo, the process is: first, she downloads 40% of 200 GB, then the system restarts for 20 minutes, then she starts over and downloads the entire 200 GB again. Wait, but that would mean she ends up with two copies of the file? Or maybe the first 40% is lost, and she has to download the whole thing again? The problem says \"den Download noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which might mean that after the restart, the download is restarted from the beginning, so the first 40% is not saved. Therefore, she has to download the entire 200 GB twice? But that seems like a lot. Let me check the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"nachdem 40 % des Downloads abgeschlossen sind, erzwingt Windows einen Neustart, um Updates zu installieren, was 20 Minuten dauert. Danach muss Carla den Download noch einmal ganz neu starten.\" So after 40% is done, the restart happens, and then she has to restart the download from the beginning. So, the first 40% is already downloaded, but then the restart happens, and then she has to start over. Wait, but if the download was interrupted, maybe the downloaded 40% is lost? Or does she continue from there? The problem says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which is \"start over again from the beginning.\" So, she has to download the entire 200 GB again, even though she had already downloaded 40% before the restart. That seems like a lot, but maybe that's how it is.\n\nSo, the total time would be the time to download 40% plus the 20 minutes for the restart, plus the time to download 100% again. Wait, but that would be 40% + 100% = 140% of the file. But maybe the first 40% is already done, and then after the restart, she has to download the entire 200 GB again.

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, then turns around because he forgot something important. Then he tries to get home within 4 hours, but gets stuck in traffic for the first 2 hours. Then he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, and then the remaining time of 4 hours at 80 mph. Wait, the question is how far away from home is he after these 4 hours?\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out his position after the initial 3 hours. Then, when he turns around, he's trying to go back home. But the problem is that he has a total of 4 hours to get home, but he gets stuck in traffic for 2 hours, then drives for half an hour at 30 mph, and then the remaining time (which is 4 hours total?) Wait, maybe I need to parse the timeline correctly.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst part: John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. So the distance from home is 3 * 60 = 180 miles. Then he realizes he forgot something and turns around. So now he's heading back home.\n\nNow, he tries to get home within 4 hours. But during these 4 hours, he gets stuck in traffic for the first 2 hours. So during those 2 hours, he's not moving. Then, after the traffic, he drives for half an hour (which is 0.5 hours) at 30 mph. Then, the remaining time of 4 hours... Wait, hold on. The total time he has to get home is 4 hours. But he spent 2 hours in traffic, then 0.5 hours driving, so the remaining time would be 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. But the problem says \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the timeline.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Er versucht, innerhalb von 4 Stunden nach Hause zu kommen, verbringt allerdings die ersten 2 Stunden im Stau. Die anschließende halbe Stunde fährt er mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 30 Meilen/Stunde, bevor er die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\"\n\nWait, maybe the 4 hours is the total time he has to get home. So he starts trying to get home, and during that 4-hour period, he spends 2 hours in traffic, then 0.5 hours at 30 mph, and then the remaining time (which would be 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. But the problem says \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\" Hmm, maybe the translation is a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal German: \"Er versucht, innerhalb von 4 Stunden nach Hause zu kommen, verbringt allerdings die ersten 2 Stunden im Stau. Die anschließende halbe Stunde fährt er mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 30 Meilen/Stunde, bevor er die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\"\n\nWait, \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden\" – that might mean that after the first 2 hours and the half hour, he has the remaining time of 4 hours? But that doesn't make sense because 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours, so remaining time would be 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours. But the problem says \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden\" – maybe it's a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the total time he has is 4 hours, and after the first 2 hours in traffic, then 0.5 hours driving, then the remaining time (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. That seems more logical.\n\nSo, let's structure it:\n\nTotal time available to get home: 4 hours.\n\nTime in traffic: 2 hours (so he doesn't move during this time).\n\nThen, after traffic, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.\n\nThen, the remaining time is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours, during which he drives at 80 mph.\n\nSo, during these 4 hours, he moves back towards home in three segments:\n\n1. 2 hours in traffic: 0 miles covered.\n\n2. 0.5 hours at 30 mph: distance covered = 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\n3. 1.5 hours at 80 mph: distance covered = 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nTotal distance covered towards home during the 4 hours: 15 + 120 = 135 miles.\n\nBut initially, he was 180 miles away from home. So after driving back 135 miles, his distance from home is 180 - 135 = 45 miles.\n\nWait, but that seems straightforward. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says he turns around after the initial 3 hours. So he was 180 miles away from home. Then he starts heading back. The total time he has to get home is 4 hours. But during those 4 hours, he gets stuck in traffic for 2 hours, then drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, then the remaining time (which is 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. So total distance covered back towards home is 15 + 120 = 135 miles. Therefore, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that the 4 hours is not the total time from when he turned around, but something else? Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"John fährt 3 Stunden lang mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 60 Meilen/Stunde und dreht dann um, weil er bemerkt, dass er etwas ganz Wichtiges zu Hause vergessen hat.

Wie weit weg von zu Hause ist er am Ende dieser 4 Stunden?\"\n\nSo, after turning around, he tries to get home within 4 hours. So the 4 hours starts when he turns around. So during those 4 hours, he spends 2 hours in traffic, then 0.5 hours at 30 mph, then the remaining time (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. Therefore, total distance covered back is 15 + 120 = 135 miles. So he was 180 miles away, now he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\" Maybe \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden\" is supposed to mean that after the first 2 hours and 0.5 hours, he has 4 hours left? But that would be inconsistent with the total time. Alternatively, maybe the translation is that after the first 2 hours and 0.5 hours, he has the remaining time (which is 4 hours minus the time already spent) to drive at 80 mph. But that would be 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours, as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the 4 hours is not the total time, but the time he has to get home, but he didn't manage to do it in 4 hours. Wait, but the question says \"am Ende dieser 4 Stunden\" – so after these 4 hours, how far is he from home. So regardless of whether he made it home or not, after 4 hours of trying to get home, how far is he from home.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct: 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut let me check again step by step.\n\nFirst, initial trip: 3 hours at 60 mph: 3*60=180 miles from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and starts heading back. The total time he has to get home is 4 hours. So during these 4 hours:\n\n- First 2 hours: stuck in traffic, so 0 miles.\n\n- Then, next 0.5 hours: driving at 30 mph. So distance covered: 0.5*30=15 miles towards home.\n\n- Then, remaining time: 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. Driving at 80 mph: 1.5*80=120 miles towards home.\n\nTotal distance covered back: 15 + 120 = 135 miles.\n\nTherefore, distance from home: 180 - 135 = 45 miles.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: maybe the 4 hours is not the total time from turning around, but the total time from the start? But the problem says \"Er versucht, innerhalb von 4 Stunden nach Hause zu kommen\" – so after turning around, he has 4 hours to get home. So the 4 hours is the time from when he turned around. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the 4 hours includes the initial 3 hours? No, because he turned around after 3 hours, and then starts trying to get home within 4 hours. So the 4 hours is separate from the initial 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 45 miles away from home.\n</think>\n\nJohn fährt zunächst 3 Stunden mit 60 Meilen/Stunde, wodurch er sich 180 Meilen von zu Hause entfernt.

So he was 180 miles away, now he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\" Maybe \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden\" is supposed to mean that after the first 2 hours and 0.5 hours, he has 4 hours left? But that would be inconsistent with the total time. Alternatively, maybe the translation is that after the first 2 hours and 0.5 hours, he has the remaining time (which is 4 hours minus the time already spent) to drive at 80 mph. But that would be 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours, as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the 4 hours is not the total time, but the time he has to get home, but he didn't manage to do it in 4 hours. Wait, but the question says \"am Ende dieser 4 Stunden\" – so after these 4 hours, how far is he from home. So regardless of whether he made it home or not, after 4 hours of trying to get home, how far is he from home.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct: 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut let me check again step by step.\n\nFirst, initial trip: 3 hours at 60 mph: 3*60=180 miles from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and starts heading back. The total time he has to get home is 4 hours. So during these 4 hours:\n\n- First 2 hours: stuck in traffic, so 0 miles.\n\n- Then, next 0.5 hours: driving at 30 mph. So distance covered: 0.5*30=15 miles towards home.\n\n- Then, remaining time: 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. Driving at 80 mph: 1.5*80=120 miles towards home.\n\nTotal distance covered back: 15 + 120 = 135 miles.\n\nTherefore, distance from home: 180 - 135 = 45 miles.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: maybe the 4 hours is not the total time from turning around, but the total time from the start? But the problem says \"Er versucht, innerhalb von 4 Stunden nach Hause zu kommen\" – so after turning around, he has 4 hours to get home. So the 4 hours is the time from when he turned around. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the 4 hours includes the initial 3 hours? No, because he turned around after 3 hours, and then starts trying to get home within 4 hours. So the 4 hours is separate from the initial 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 45 miles away from home.\n</think>\n\nJohn fährt zunächst 3 Stunden mit 60 Meilen/Stunde, wodurch er sich 180 Meilen von zu Hause entfernt.

Carlos plants a lemon tree that costs $90. Each year, it produces 7 lemons, which he sells for $1.50 each. But it also costs $3 per year to water and fertilize the tree. The question is, how many years does it take before he starts making a profit?\n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out the total cost and the total revenue over the years. The initial cost is $90 for planting the tree. Then, every year, there's an additional cost of $3 for maintenance. On the revenue side, each year he gets 7 lemons times $1.50 each. Let me calculate that first.\n\nSo, revenue per year: 7 lemons * $1.50 = $10.50 per year. Then, the cost per year is $3. So, the profit per year would be $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year. But wait, there's also the initial cost of $90. So, he needs to cover that initial cost before he starts making a profit, right?\n\nSo, the total cost is $90 plus $3 per year. The total revenue is $10.50 per year. So, the net profit each year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50, but he has to first recover the initial $90. So, the question is, how many years does it take for the total revenue to exceed the total cost?\n\nLet me set up an equation. Let's let x be the number of years. Total revenue after x years is 10.50 * x. Total cost is 90 + 3 * x. We need to find the smallest x where 10.50x > 90 + 3x.\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides: 7.50x > 90. Then, divide both sides by 7.50: x > 90 / 7.50. Let me calculate that. 90 divided by 7.5. Well, 7.5 times 12 is 90, because 7.5*10=75, 7.5*2=15, so 75+15=90. So, 90 divided by 7.5 is 12. So, x > 12. That means after 12 years, he would have broken even, but since we need to make a profit, it would be 13 years? Wait, but let me check.\n\nWait, if x is 12, then total revenue is 10.50*12 = $126. Total cost is 90 + 3*12 = 90 + 36 = $126. So, at 12 years, he breaks even. So, to start making a profit, he needs to go into the 13th year. Therefore, the answer is 13 years.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's check year by year. Let's see:\n\nYear 1: Revenue 10.50, cost 3, net profit 7.50. But total cost is 90 + 3 = 93. So, total profit after 1 year is 10.50 - 93 = -82.50. Still in the red.\n\nYear 2: Revenue 21, cost 6, total revenue 21, total cost 90 + 6 = 96. Profit: 21 - 96 = -75.\n\nYear 3: 31.50 - 99 = -67.50.\n\nContinuing this way, each year the profit increases by 7.50. So, after x years, the total profit is 7.50x - 90. Wait, because each year he makes 7.50 profit, but he has to subtract the initial 90. So, 7.50x - 90 > 0. So, 7.50x > 90, x > 12. So, same result. So, after 12 years, he has 7.50*12 = 90, so total profit is 0. So, he breaks even at 12 years. Therefore, to have a profit, it's 13 years.\n\nBut the question says \"bevor er mit dem Zitronenbaum Geld verdient\" which translates to \"before he starts making money with the lemon tree.\" So, does that mean when does he start making a profit, which would be after 12 years? Wait, but at 12 years, he breaks even. So, he hasn't made a profit yet. So, the first year he makes a profit is year 13. Therefore, the answer is 13 years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the initial cost is a one-time cost, and the annual costs are ongoing. So, the total cost is 90 + 3x, and the total revenue is 10.50x. So, when does 10.50x > 90 + 3x? Which is when x > 12. So, 13 years.

Melanie is a salesperson who sold vacuum cleaners. The problem says she has a third of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, 2 more in the red house, and half of the remaining in the orange house. She ends up with 5 vacuum cleaners left. The question is, how many did she start with?\n\nHmm, I need to figure out the initial number. Let me break it down step by step. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with \"x\".\n\nFirst, she sold a third of them in the green house. So that's (1/3)x. Then, she sold 2 more in the red house. So after the green and red houses, she has sold (1/3)x + 2. Therefore, the remaining vacuum cleaners after green and red would be x - [(1/3)x + 2]. Let me compute that:\n\nx - (1/3)x - 2 = (2/3)x - 2.\n\nThen, she sold half of the remaining in the orange house. So half of (2/3)x - 2 is [(2/3)x - 2]/2. After selling that, she has the other half left, which is also [(2/3)x - 2]/2. And this is equal to 5, according to the problem.\n\nSo, [(2/3)x - 2]/2 = 5. Let me solve this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (2/3)x - 2 = 10.\n\nThen add 2 to both sides: (2/3)x = 12.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/2: x = 12 * (3/2) = 18.\n\nWait, so she started with 18 vacuum cleaners? Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nStart with 18. Green house: 1/3 of 18 is 6. So she sold 6 there. Then 2 more in the red house, so total sold so far is 6 + 2 = 8. Remaining is 18 - 8 = 10. Then she sold half of the remaining in the orange house, which is 5. So she sold 5 in orange, leaving 5. That matches the problem statement. So yes, 18 seems correct.\n\nBut let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The key steps are:\n\n1. Total: x\n2. Green: (1/3)x\n3. Red: 2\n4. Remaining after green and red: x - (1/3)x - 2 = (2/3)x - 2\n5. Orange: half of that, so [(2/3)x - 2]/2\n6. Remaining after orange: same as above, which is 5.\n\nSo equation: [(2/3)x - 2]/2 = 5. Multiply both sides by 2: (2/3)x - 2 = 10. Then (2/3)x = 12. Multiply by 3/2: x = 18. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If after selling in green and red, she had (2/3)x - 2 left, and then half of that is sold in orange, leaving half. So half of (2/3)x - 2 is 5. Therefore, (2/3)x - 2 = 10. Then solving gives x = 18. All steps seem consistent.\n\nI think that's the right answer. Let me just confirm once more with the numbers:\n\nStart with 18.\n\nGreen: 18 / 3 = 6 sold. Remaining: 12.\n\nRed: 2 sold. Remaining: 12 - 2 = 10.\n\nOrange: half of 10 is 5 sold. Remaining: 5.

I need to figure out what percentage of the 20 students signed up for Hip-Hop. The problem says that 20% chose Contemporary Dance, then 25% of the remaining students chose Jazz Dance, and the rest went for Hip-Hop. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 20 students in total. Let me start with the Contemporary Dance. 20% of 20 students. To calculate that, I can do 20% of 20. 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal. So 0.20 multiplied by 20. Let me compute that: 0.20 * 20 = 4. So, 4 students chose Contemporary Dance.\n\nNow, the problem says that 25% of the remaining students chose Jazz Dance. The remaining students after Contemporary Dance would be the total minus those who chose Contemporary. So, 20 total minus 4 who did Contemporary equals 16 students left. So, 25% of these 16 students are Jazz Dance. Let me calculate that. 25% is 0.25, so 0.25 * 16. Hmm, 0.25 times 16 is 4. So, 4 students chose Jazz Dance.\n\nNow, the rest of the students are those who signed up for Hip-Hop. So, total students minus Contemporary minus Jazz. That would be 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students. So, 12 students chose Hip-Hop. Now, the question asks for the percentage of all students who signed up for Hip-Hop. So, 12 out of 20. To find the percentage, I can do (12 / 20) * 100. Let me compute that. 12 divided by 20 is 0.6, and 0.6 times 100 is 60%. So, 60% of the students chose Hip-Hop.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that right. 20% of 20 is 4, that's correct. Then 25% of the remaining 16 is 4, yes. Then 20 - 4 - 4 = 12. 12/20 is indeed 0.6, so 60%. That seems right. But let me think again if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says \"25% of the rest\" for Jazz Dance. The rest after Contemporary, which is 16, so 25% of 16 is 4. Then the rest is 12. So yes, 12 students. So 12/20 is 60%. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do this using percentages without calculating the actual numbers. Let's see. Total is 100%. Contemporary is 20%, so the remaining is 80%. Then 25% of that 80% is Jazz Dance. So, 25% of 80% is 0.25 * 80% = 20%. Therefore, Jazz Dance is 20%, and the rest is 100% - 20% (Contemporary) - 20% (Jazz) = 60% Hip-Hop. Oh, that's another way to look at it. So that confirms the answer is 60%.\n\nSo both methods give me 60%, so I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The key was to first take 20% of the total for Contemporary, then 25% of the remaining for Jazz, and the rest is Hip-Hop. Either by calculating the numbers or by working with percentages directly, the result is 60%.\n</think>\n\nIn einer Tanzstunde mit 20 Schülern:\n\n1. **Contemporary Dance**:  \n   20 % von 20 Schülern = $ 0{,}20 \\times 20 = 4 $ Schüler.\n\n2. **Jazz Dance**:  \n   Der Rest nach Contemporary Dance: $ 20 - 4 = 16 $ Schüler.  \n   25 % von 16 Schülern = $ 0{,}25 \\times 16 = 4 $ Schüler.\n\n3. **Hip-Hop**:  \n   Restliche Schüler: $ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 $ Schüler.  \n   Prozentual: $ \\frac{12}{20} \\times 100 = 60\\% $.\n\n**Antwort:** 60 % aller Schüler haben sich für Hip-Hop angemeldet."]], "filtered_resps": ["<think>\nOkay, let's see.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 20 students in total. Let me start with the Contemporary Dance. 20% of 20 students. To calculate that, I can do 20% of 20. 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal. So 0.20 multiplied by 20. Let me compute that: 0.20 * 20 = 4. So, 4 students chose Contemporary Dance.\n\nNow, the problem says that 25% of the remaining students chose Jazz Dance. The remaining students after Contemporary Dance would be the total minus those who chose Contemporary. So, 20 total minus 4 who did Contemporary equals 16 students left. So, 25% of these 16 students are Jazz Dance. Let me calculate that. 25% is 0.25, so 0.25 * 16. Hmm, 0.25 times 16 is 4. So, 4 students chose Jazz Dance.\n\nNow, the rest of the students are those who signed up for Hip-Hop. So, total students minus Contemporary minus Jazz. That would be 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students. So, 12 students chose Hip-Hop. Now, the question asks for the percentage of all students who signed up for Hip-Hop. So, 12 out of 20. To find the percentage, I can do (12 / 20) * 100. Let me compute that. 12 divided by 20 is 0.6, and 0.6 times 100 is 60%. So, 60% of the students chose Hip-Hop.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that right. 20% of 20 is 4, that's correct. Then 25% of the remaining 16 is 4, yes. Then 20 - 4 - 4 = 12. 12/20 is indeed 0.6, so 60%. That seems right. But let me think again if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says \"25% of the rest\" for Jazz Dance. The rest after Contemporary, which is 16, so 25% of 16 is 4. Then the rest is 12. So yes, 12 students. So 12/20 is 60%. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do this using percentages without calculating the actual numbers. Let's see. Total is 100%. Contemporary is 20%, so the remaining is 80%. Then 25% of that 80% is Jazz Dance. So, 25% of 80% is 0.25 * 80% = 20%. Therefore, Jazz Dance is 20%, and the rest is 100% - 20% (Contemporary) - 20% (Jazz) = 60% Hip-Hop. Oh, that's another way to look at it. So that confirms the answer is 60%.\n\nSo both methods give me 60%, so I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The key was to first take 20% of the total for Contemporary, then 25% of the remaining for Jazz, and the rest is Hip-Hop. Either by calculating the numbers or by working with percentages directly, the result is 60%.\n</think>\n\nIn einer Tanzstunde mit 20 Schülern:\n\n1. **Contemporary Dance**:  \n   20 % von 20 Schülern = $ 0{,}20 \\times 20 = 4 $ Schüler.\n\n2. **Jazz Dance**:  \n   Der Rest nach Contemporary Dance: $ 20 - 4 = 16 $ Schüler.  \n   25 % von 16 Schülern = $ 0{,}25 \\times 16 = 4 $ Schüler.\n\n3. **Hip-Hop**:  \n   Restliche Schüler: $ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 $ Schüler.  \n   Prozentual: $ \\frac{12}{20} \\times 100 = 60\\% $.\n\n**Antwort:** 60 % aller Schüler haben sich für Hip-Hop angemeldet."], "doc_hash": "e455de0212ac8c8689e4b3f4c65cf57ad1d9eee56ae1298b51d3daeb0f00a29b", "prompt_hash": "ee4881e053b9b734537967517d6a81d74785af3c5a02e6b075776bf7e1c3a62a", "target_hash": "39fa9ec190eee7b6f4dff1100d6343e10918d044c75eac8f9e9a2596173f80c9", "exact_match": 0.0}

The trader has to choose between buying jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. The financial advisor says the jewelry market will grow by 2.5% and the electronics market by 1.2% in the same month. The goal is to maximize profit, so I need to calculate the profit from each option and see which one is higher.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is meant by the market growth. If the market is growing by a certain percentage, does that mean the value of the items increases by that percentage? So, if the trader buys jewelry now, by the end of the month, its value would be 5,000 plus 2.5% of 5,000. Similarly for electronics, 8,000 plus 1.2% of 8,000. But wait, the question is about profit. So, if the trader buys the items now and sells them at the end of the month, the profit would be the increase in value. But is that the case here?\n\nWait, the problem says the trader wants to make a purchase decision. So maybe he's buying the items now and then selling them later. But the problem doesn't mention any cost of purchase or selling price. Hmm. Wait, maybe the profit is just the appreciation of the items' value. So if he buys the jewelry for $5,000 and sells it at the end of the month when the market has grown by 2.5%, then his selling price would be 5,000 * 1.025. Similarly for electronics, 8,000 * 1.012. Then the profit would be the selling price minus the initial cost. So for jewelry, profit is 5,000 * 0.025, and for electronics, 8,000 * 0.012. Then compare the two profits.\n\nLet me check that. If the market grows by 2.5%, then the value increases by 2.5% of the original amount. So the profit would be 2.5% of 5,000, which is 5,000 * 0.025 = 125. For electronics, 8,000 * 0.012 = 96. So the profit from jewelry is higher. Therefore, the trader should choose jewelry, and the maximum profit would be $125.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to consider the total value at the end of the month. If the trader buys the items and sells them, the total value would be 5,000 * 1.025 = 5,125 for jewelry, and 8,000 * 1.012 = 8,096 for electronics. But the profit is the difference between the selling price and the purchase price. So for jewelry, 5,125 - 5,000 = 125, and for electronics, 8,096 - 8,000 = 96. So yes, the profit is indeed 125 vs. 96. Therefore, the maximum profit is $125.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"Gewinn maximieren\" which is \"maximize profit\". So the answer is $125. But let me make sure there's no other interpretation. Maybe the trader is not selling the items but just holding them, but the problem states that the markets are growing, so the profit would be the increase in value. Alternatively, if the trader is buying the items and then selling them, the profit is the appreciation. So I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a different approach? For example, if the trader has a certain amount of money to invest, but the problem states the value of the items. Wait, the problem says the trader wants to make a purchase decision between two options: buying jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000.

So if they go west 80 and then north 150, the total distance is indeed 230 miles. But maybe the problem is a classic Pythagorean theorem question where they want the straight-line distance from San Rafael to the final point? Let me think.\n\nIf the first day they go west 80 miles, then the next day north 150 miles, their path forms a right-angled triangle with legs 80 and 150. The straight-line distance would be sqrt(80² + 150²). Let me calculate that. 80 squared is 6400, 150 squared is 22500. Adding them gives 28900. The square root of 28900 is 170. So the straight-line distance is 170 miles. But the question is about the total distance traveled, not the displacement. So if they ask for the total distance, it's 80 + 150 = 230.

If she works 50 weeks a year, and each week she works 35 hours teaching and 15 hours coaching, then yes, that's correct. So total per week is 35*20 + 15*30 = 700 + 450 = 1150.

If the original had \"35 Wochen\" instead of \"35 Stunden\", that would be a problem. But given that \"15 Stunden pro Woche\" is correct, then \"35 Wochen\" must be a typo.

I need to figure out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters after mixing the orange drink and pineapple drink, considering I spilled one liter of the orange drink. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink would be 10 liters multiplied by 2/3. Let me calculate that: 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 ≈ 6.666... liters of water. And the rest is probably orange juice, which would be 10 - 20/3 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333... liters. But maybe I don't need the orange juice part, just the water.\n\nThen there's the pineapple drink, which is 15 liters, and three-fifths of that is water. So, water in pineapple drink is 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters. The rest is pineapple juice, which would be 15 - 9 = 6 liters. Again, maybe I don't need the pineapple juice part.\n\nBut wait, the problem says I'm adding the orange drink to the pineapple drink. However, I spilled one liter of the orange drink during the process. So, the total volume after adding would be... Let me think. Originally, I have 10 liters of orange drink, but I spilled 1 liter, so I have 9 liters left. Then I add that to the 15 liters of pineapple drink. So total volume would be 9 + 15 = 24 liters, which matches the question's mention of \"verbleibenden 24 Litern\" (remaining 24 liters). So that checks out.\n\nSo, the total water would be the water from the remaining orange drink plus the water from the pineapple drink. The spilled liter of orange drink was part of the original 10 liters, so I need to subtract the water from that spilled liter. Wait, but the question says I spilled one liter of the orange drink while pouring it into the pineapple drink. So, the spilled liter is not part of the final mixture. Therefore, the remaining orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters, and the water in that is 9 liters * (2/3) = 6 liters. Then the pineapple drink is 15 liters with 9 liters of water. So total water is 6 + 9 = 15 liters?\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original orange drink is 10 liters with 2/3 water. If I spill 1 liter of it, how much water is in that spilled liter? Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the spilled liter would contain 2/3 liters of water. Therefore, the remaining orange drink is 9 liters, which has 9 * (2/3) = 6 liters of water. Then the pineapple drink is 15 liters with 3/5 water, which is 9 liters. So total water is 6 + 9 = 15 liters. Therefore, the answer is 15 liters?\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"verbleibenden 24 Litern\" which is the remaining 24 liters after the spill. So the total volume is 24 liters, which is 9 liters of orange drink (after spill) plus 15 liters of pineapple drink. So yes, that's 24 liters. The water is 6 liters from orange and 9 liters from pineapple, totaling 15 liters. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I need to check if the spilled liter is considered as part of the original 10 liters. So, the original orange drink has 10 liters, 2/3 water. If I spill 1 liter, which is 2/3 water, then the remaining orange drink is 9 liters with 2/3 water. So 9*(2/3) = 6 liters. Then pineapple is 15 liters with 3/5 water, which is 9 liters. So total water is 6 + 9 = 15 liters. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the total water in the original orange drink before spill: 10*(2/3) = 20/3 ≈ 6.666 liters. Then subtract the water spilled: 2/3 liters. So 20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 = 6 liters. Then add pineapple's 9 liters. Total 6 + 9 = 15 liters. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the answer should be 15 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters.

I need to figure out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters after mixing the orange drink and pineapple drink, considering I spilled one liter of the orange drink. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink would be 10 liters multiplied by 2/3. Let me calculate that: 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 ≈ 6.666... liters of water. And the rest is probably orange juice, which would be 10 - 20/3 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333... liters. But maybe I don't need the orange juice part, just the water.\n\nThen there's the pineapple drink, which is 15 liters, and three-fifths of that is water. So, water in pineapple drink is 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters. The rest is pineapple juice, which would be 15 - 9 = 6 liters. Again, maybe I don't need the pineapple juice part.\n\nBut wait, the problem says I'm adding the orange drink to the pineapple drink. However, I spilled one liter of the orange drink during the process. So, the total volume after adding would be... Let me think. Originally, I have 10 liters of orange drink, but I spilled 1 liter, so I have 9 liters left. Then I add that to the 15 liters of pineapple drink. So total volume would be 9 + 15 = 24 liters, which matches the question's mention of \"verbleibenden 24 Litern\" (remaining 24 liters). So that checks out.\n\nSo, the total water would be the water from the remaining orange drink plus the water from the pineapple drink. The spilled liter of orange drink was part of the original 10 liters, so I need to subtract the water from that spilled liter. Wait, but the question says I spilled one liter of the orange drink while pouring it into the pineapple drink. So, the spilled liter is not part of the final mixture. Therefore, the remaining orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters, and the water in that is 9 liters * (2/3) = 6 liters. Then the pineapple drink is 15 liters with 9 liters of water. So total water is 6 + 9 = 15 liters?\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original orange drink is 10 liters with 2/3 water. If I spill 1 liter of it, how much water is in that spilled liter? Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the spilled liter would contain 2/3 liters of water. Therefore, the remaining orange drink is 9 liters, which has 9 * (2/3) = 6 liters of water. Then the pineapple drink is 15 liters with 3/5 water, which is 9 liters. So total water is 6 + 9 = 15 liters. Therefore, the answer is 15 liters?\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"verbleibenden 24 Litern\" which is the remaining 24 liters after the spill. So the total volume is 24 liters, which is 9 liters of orange drink (after spill) plus 15 liters of pineapple drink. So yes, that's 24 liters. The water is 6 liters from orange and 9 liters from pineapple, totaling 15 liters. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I need to check if the spilled liter is considered as part of the original 10 liters. So, the original orange drink has 10 liters, 2/3 water. If I spill 1 liter, which is 2/3 water, then the remaining orange drink is 9 liters with 2/3 water. So 9*(2/3) = 6 liters. Then pineapple is 15 liters with 3/5 water, which is 9 liters. So total water is 6 + 9 = 15 liters. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the total water in the original orange drink before spill: 10*(2/3) = 20/3 ≈ 6.666 liters. Then subtract the water spilled: 2/3 liters. So 20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 = 6 liters. Then add pineapple's 9 liters. Total 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

If the original price is, let's say, P dollars, then 75% of P is equal to $19.50. So, 0.75 * P = 19.50. To find P, I need to divide both sides by 0.75. That makes sense. So P = 19.50 / 0.75.

Because 100% minus 25% is 75%. So, $19.50 is 75% of the original price. \n\nWait, how do I convert that into an equation? Let me think. If the original price is, let's say, P dollars, then 75% of P is equal to $19.50. So, 0.75 * P = 19.50. To find P, I need to divide both sides by 0.75. That makes sense. So P = 19.50 / 0.75. Let me do that calculation. \n\nDividing 19.50 by 0.75. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this. 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 19.50 * (4/3). Let me compute that. 19.50 divided by 3 is 6.50, and then multiplied by 4 is 26.00. So the original price was $26.00. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If the original price was $26, then 25% of that is 6.50, so subtracting that from 26 gives 19.50, which matches what Kyle paid. Yeah, that seems right.

The problem says that the age ratio of Darrell and Allen is 7:11, and together they are 162 years old. I need to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the ratio of their ages is 7:11. That means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11 years. So, if I let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is some common multiplier. That makes sense because ratios can be represented as multiples of a common factor.\n\nNow, their combined ages are 162. So, adding their ages together: 7x + 11x = 162. Let me check that. Yes, combining like terms, that would be 18x = 162. Then, solving for x, I divide both sides by 18. So, x = 162 / 18. Let me calculate that. 18 times 9 is 162, right? 18*9=162. So x is 9.\n\nOkay, so Darrell's current age is 7x, which is 7*9 = 63 years old. And Allen's current age is 11x, which is 11*9 = 99 years old. Wait, that seems a bit old for Allen, but maybe it's possible. Let me verify the total. 63 + 99 = 162. Yes, that adds up correctly.\n\nNow, the question asks how old Allen will be in 10 years. So, Allen is currently 99, so in 10 years, he'll be 99 + 10 = 109 years old. Hmm, that seems really old, but mathematically, it checks out. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the ratio part.\n\nThe ratio 7:11, so 7 parts to 11 parts. Total parts are 18. 162 divided by 18 is indeed 9. So each part is 9 years. Therefore, Darrell is 7*9=63, Allen is 11*9=99. Adding them gives 162. Then adding 10 years to Allen's age gives 109. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of the ratio. Is it possible that the ratio is reversed? Like, maybe Darrell is older than Allen? But the ratio is given as Darrell to Allen as 7:11, so Darrell is younger. So 7:11, Darrell is 7 parts, Allen is 11 parts. So the math is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the question is asking for Allen's age in 10 years, which is 99 +10=109.

John has 10 dogs, right? Each dog needs 0.5 hours a day for a walk and to take care of their business. The question is asking how many hours per week he spends taking care of the dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the daily time spent per dog. Each dog requires 0.5 hours a day. So for 10 dogs, that would be 10 multiplied by 0.5 hours. Let me calculate that: 10 * 0.5 = 5 hours per day. That makes sense because each dog takes half an hour, so 10 dogs would take 5 hours in total each day.\n\nNow, the question is about the total hours per week.

Then he buys 8 video games at $20 each and has $5 left. The question is how many Lego sets does he have left?\n\nWait, if he sold all his Lego sets, then he should have none left. But maybe the problem is in German, and \"seine gesamtes Spielzeug\" might not be all his toys, but maybe he has other toys too? Wait, the problem says \"Er hat 13 Lego-Sets und verkauft sie...\" So he has 13 Lego sets and sells them. So he sells all 13. Then the answer would be zero. But that seems too easy. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he didn't sell all of them? Wait, the problem says \"sein gesamtes Spielzeug zu verkaufen\" which is \"to sell all his toys\". But he has 13 Lego sets, which are part of his toys. So he sells all his toys, which includes the 13 Lego sets. Therefore, he has none left. But then why mention the video games and the money? Maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is zero, but maybe there's a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let me check the math. Let's see:\n\nTotal money from selling Lego sets: 13 * $15 = $195.\n\nHe buys 8 video games at $20 each: 8 * $20 = $160.\n\nHe has $5 left. So total money he had was $160 + $5 = $165.\n\nBut he got $195 from selling the Lego sets. So he has $195 - $165 = $30 left? Wait, but the problem says he has $5 left after buying the video games. So maybe the $5 is after buying the video games. So the total money he had was $160 + $5 = $165. But he sold the Lego sets for $195. So he has $195 - $165 = $30 left? But the problem says he has $5 left. Wait, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check again. Let me rephrase:\n\nHe sells all 13 Lego sets for $15 each: 13 * 15 = $195.\n\nHe uses this money to buy 8 video games at $20 each: 8 * 20 = $160.\n\nHe has $5 left. So total money he had was $160 + $5 = $165. But he sold the Lego sets for $195. So where is the discrepancy? $195 - $165 = $30. So he should have $30 left, but the problem says he has $5 left. That doesn't add up. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, maybe he didn't sell all his Lego sets. Maybe he sold some and kept some. But the problem says \"Er hat 13 Lego-Sets und verkauft sie...\" which translates to \"He has 13 Lego sets and sells them...\" So \"sie\" refers to the 13 Lego sets. So he sells all 13. But then the math doesn't add up. Let me check again:\n\nTotal from selling Lego: 13 * 15 = 195.\n\nTotal spent on video games: 8 * 20 = 160.\n\nLeftover: 5.\n\nSo total money he had was 160 + 5 = 165. But he sold the Lego for 195. So he should have 195 - 165 = 30 left. But the problem says he has 5 left. That's a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem or my interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that he didn't sell all the Lego sets. Maybe he sold some and kept some. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me assume that he sold x Lego sets, and kept (13 - x) sets. Then the money from selling is 15x. He uses that money to buy 8 video games for 20 each, so 160, and has 5 left. So total money he had is 160 + 5 = 165. Therefore, 15x = 165. So x = 11. Therefore, he sold 11 Lego sets and kept 13 - 11 = 2. So the answer would be 2.\n\nBut the problem says \"Er hat 13 Lego-Sets und verkauft sie...\" which is \"He has 13 Lego sets and sells them...\" So \"sie\" refers to the 13 sets. So he sells all of them. But that leads to inconsistency in the math. Therefore, maybe the original problem has a typo, or the translation is slightly off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in German and \"verkauft sie\" might not mean all of them. Maybe \"sie\" refers to some of them, but the translation is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is zero, but the math doesn't add up. Let me check again:\n\nIf he sells all 13 Lego sets for 15 each: 13*15=195.\n\nBuys 8 games for 20 each: 8*20=160.\n\nLeft with 5. So total money he had was 160 +5=165. But he sold the Lego for 195. So he should have 195 - 165 = 30 left. But the problem says he has 5 left. Therefore, there's a discrepancy of 25. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the 5 dollars is after buying the video games, but he also had some money before selling the Lego sets. But the problem doesn't mention that. It says he sells all his toys (the Lego sets) and uses the money to buy video games. So he starts with zero money, sells the Lego for 195, buys games for 160, and has 5 left. But 195 - 160 = 35, not 5. So that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's numbers, or perhaps the translation is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking how many Lego sets he has left after selling some, but the translation is off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in German and \"verkauft sie\" refers to selling some of them, not all. If that's the case, then solving for x:\n\n15x = 8*20 +5 = 165 → x=11. So he sold 11, kept 2. Therefore, answer is 2.\n\nBut the original problem says \"Er hat 13 Lego-Sets und verkauft sie...\" which would mean \"He has 13 Lego sets and sells them...\" implying all of them. But if that's the case, the math doesn't add up. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is 2, assuming that he didn't sell all of them, and the problem has a translation error or typo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is zero, but the numbers are wrong. However, since the user is asking for the answer, and given that in the calculation if we assume he sold 11, then the answer is 2, which makes the math work, I think that's the intended solution.

So maybe I can use that to find her running speed first?\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n- Hopping speed = 3 mph\n- Hopping speed = ½ × Running speed\n- Therefore, Running speed = 2 × Hopping speed = 2 × 3 = 6 mph\n- Running speed is 4 times walking speed, so Walking speed = Running speed / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 mph\n\nOkay, so her walking speed is 1.5 mph, running is 6 mph, and hopping is 3 mph. But the question is about her running and walking, not hopping. Wait, the problem says she spends a third of the time running and two-thirds walking. So hopping is mentioned here, but maybe that's just to find her running speed? Because they didn't directly give her running speed, but gave her hopping speed instead. So that's how we get the running speed.\n\nNow, the total time is six hours. She spends 1/3 of that time running and 2/3 walking. Let me calculate the time spent on each activity.\n\nTime running = (1/3) × 6 hours = 2 hours\nTime walking = (2/3) × 6 hours = 4 hours\n\nSo she runs for 2 hours at 6 mph and walks for 4 hours at 1.5 mph. Then the total distance would be the sum of the distances from each activity.\n\nDistance running = speed × time = 6 mph × 2 h = 12 miles\nDistance walking = 1.5 mph × 4 h = 6 miles\n\nTotal distance = 12 + 6 = 18 miles\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if I missed anything. The problem mentions hopping, but the question is about running and walking. The hopping part was just to find her running speed, right? Because they said she can hop at half her running speed, and that's 3 mph. So that gives us the running speed. Then the rest is just calculating the distances based on the given time fractions. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations:\n\nRunning speed: 2 × 3 = 6 mph. Correct.\n\nWalking speed: 6 / 4 = 1.5 mph. Correct.\n\nTime running: 6 × 1/3 = 2 hours.

So the problem is about Polly and the dragon Perg. The dragon is on a mountain and can breathe fire up to 1000 feet around him. Polly has a golden spear that she can throw, but without the sapphire gem, she can only throw it 400 feet. But when she holds the sapphire, she can throw it three times as far. The question is, if she holds the sapphire, how far outside the dragon's fire range can she stand and still hit the dragon with the spear?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, without the sapphire, her throw is 400 feet. But with the sapphire, it's three times that, so 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. The dragon's fire range is 1000 feet. So normally, without the sapphire, she can't reach the dragon because 400 is less than 1000. But with the sapphire, she can throw it 1200 feet. The question is, how much further beyond the 1000 feet can she stand and still hit the dragon?\n\nWait, so if the dragon's fire is a circle with a radius of 1000 feet, then anything within that circle is in the fire. So Polly needs to be outside that circle but still within the range of her spear. So the maximum distance she can be from the dragon and still hit him is 1200 feet. But the dragon's fire only reaches 1000 feet. So the difference between her maximum throw distance and the dragon's fire range is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet. Therefore, she can stand 200 feet outside the fire range and still hit the dragon.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If the dragon is at the center, and the fire is a circle of radius 1000 feet. If Polly is standing at a distance of 1000 feet, that's exactly on the edge of the fire. If she can throw the spear 1200 feet, then she can stand up to 1200 feet away from the dragon and hit him. So the distance beyond the fire range would be 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet. So she can be 200 feet outside the fire's reach and still hit the dragon. That seems right.\n\nBut maybe I need to visualize it. Imagine the dragon is at point D, and Polly is at point P. The fire range is a circle with radius 1000 feet around D. If Polly is outside this circle, she's safe from the fire. But she can throw the spear up to 1200 feet. So the maximum distance between D and P where she can still hit the dragon is 1200 feet. Therefore, the distance from the edge of the fire (which is 1000 feet from D) to the point where she can stand and still hit the dragon is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

To be outside, she needs to be more than 1000 feet away. But she can throw the spear up to 1200 feet. So the maximum distance she can be from the dragon and still hit him is 1200 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the fire range is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet. So she can be 200 feet outside the fire range and still hit the dragon.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

That would be 40 minus 14. Let me subtract those: 40 minus 14 is 26. So the guests took 26 pieces.\n\nWait, let me check again. 5 pies, each cut into 8 pieces. 5x8=40. Correct. Then 40-14=26. That seems straightforward. Hmm, is there any trick here? Maybe I need to consider if all the pies were actually on the table? The problem says she put five pies on the buffet table. So all five pies were available, so all 40 pieces were there. Then after eating, 14 left. So yes, 40-14=26. That should be the answer.\n\nI don't think there's any other detail I'm missing. The problem states that she baked 5 pies, cut each into 8, put them on the table, and after the guests ate, 14 were left. So the calculation is correct. The answer is 26 pieces taken by the guests.\n</think>\n\nGroßmama Jones hat 5 Apfelkuchen gebacken, die jeweils in 8 Stücke geschnitten wurden. Das ergibt insgesamt $5 \\times 8 = 40$ Stücke.

The question is about how many grams of chips I can eat without exceeding my daily calorie goal. So, the information given is that a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, and a 300g bag contains 5 servings. I've already eaten 1800 calories today, and my goal is 2000. So I need to figure out how many grams of chips I can eat to stay within the remaining 200 calories.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many calories are in one serving. Wait, the problem says each serving is 250 calories. But the bag is 300g and has 5 servings. So each serving is 300g divided by 5, which is 60g per serving. That makes sense. So each serving is 60g and 250 calories.\n\nNow, I have 200 calories left. So how many servings can I have? If each serving is 250 calories, but I can only have 200, that's less than one serving. Wait, but maybe I need to calculate the exact amount. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should find out the calorie per gram first. If 60g is 250 calories, then per gram it's 250 divided by 60. Let me calculate that. 250 divided by 60 is approximately 4.1667 calories per gram. So each gram of chips has about 4.1667 calories.\n\nBut I need to find out how many grams I can eat with 200 calories. So if 1 gram is 4.1667 calories, then 200 calories would be 200 divided by 4.1667. Let me do that division. 200 divided by 4.1667 is approximately 48 grams. Wait, because 4.1667 times 48 is 200. Let me check that. 4.1667 * 48 = 200. Yes, because 4.1667 is 25/6, so 25/6 * 48 = 25 * 8 = 200. Exactly. So that's 48 grams.\n\nAlternatively, since each serving is 60g for 250 calories, then 200 calories would be (200/250) * 60g. That's 0.8 * 60 = 48 grams. That's another way to calculate it. So either way, the answer is 48 grams.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The total calories allowed are 200. Each serving is 250 calories, which is more than 200. So I can't have a full serving. So 200 calories is 200/250 = 0.8 of a serving. Since each serving is 60g, 0.8 * 60 = 48g.

Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. The question is about calculating his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that from each pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles. So, if he makes 20 candles, how many pounds of beeswax does he need? Well, if 10 candles come from 1 pound, then 20 candles would need 2 pounds of beeswax. That makes sense because 20 divided by 10 is 2. So, 2 pounds of beeswax required.\n\nNext, the cost of the materials. The problem states that the materials (which includes the beeswax and the wicks) cost $10.00 per pound of beeswax. Wait, is that per pound or per candle? Let me check again. It says, \"Das Zubehör aus einem Pfund Bienenwachs plus Dochte kostet 10,00 US-Dollar.\" Translating that, it's \"The accessories from one pound of beeswax plus wicks cost $10.00.\" So, the total cost for one pound of beeswax plus wicks is $10.00. So, that's the cost per pound. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost would be 2 times $10.00, which is $20.00. So, the total cost for materials is $20.00.\n\nNow, the selling price. Each candle is sold for $2.00. If he sells 20 candles, then the total revenue is 20 times $2.00, which is $40.00.\n\nTo find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. So, $40.00 (revenue) minus $20.00 (cost) equals $20.00. Therefore, his net profit is $20.00.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"Zubehör aus einem Pfund Bienenwachs plus Dochte kostet 10,00 US-Dollar.\" So, does that mean that the cost for the materials (beeswax and wicks) is $10 per pound? So, for each pound of beeswax, the cost is $10. So, if he uses 2 pounds, that's 2 * $10 = $20. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that the $10 is the cost for the wicks and other accessories, and the beeswax is separate? But the wording says \"Zubehör aus einem Pfund Bienenwachs plus Dochte kostet 10,00 US-Dollar.\" So, \"accessories from one pound of beeswax plus wicks cost $10.\" That seems like the total cost for the materials needed to make the candles from one pound of beeswax, including the wicks. So, the $10 is the total cost for the beeswax and the wicks for one pound. Therefore, for two pounds, it's $20. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total revenue is 20 candles * $2 = $40. Total cost is $20. Profit is $40 - $20 = $20. So, the answer should be $20.00.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just make sure there's no trick here.

The question is about the Doubtfire sisters who have adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Then their mom calls to say that their two housecats have given birth to kittens. The first cat, Patchy, has three times as many kittens as the adopted ones, and the other cat, Trixie, has 12 kittens. The question is asking how many kittens the Doubtfires have now.\n\nAlright, so first, let me break down the information. The sisters already have 7 adopted kittens. Then, their two housecats, Patchy and Trixie, have each given birth to some kittens. The total number of kittens they have now would be the original 7 plus the new ones from Patchy and Trixie.\n\nThe problem says Patchy has three times as many kittens as the adopted ones. Wait, the adopted ones are the 7 kittens they took from the shelter. So does that mean Patchy has 3 times 7? Let me check that again. The wording is: \"Patchy, the first cat, three times as many kittens as the adopted, while Trixie, the other cat 12 brought to the world.\" So yes, \"as the adopted\" refers to the 7 adopted kittens. So Patchy's kittens are 3 * 7 = 21. Then Trixie has 12. So total new kittens are 21 + 12 = 33. Then adding the original 7, that would be 7 + 33 = 40. So the total number of kittens they have now is 40?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret. The problem says \"die adoptierten, während Trixie... 12 zur Welt gebracht hat.\" So \"die adoptierten\" refers to the 7 kittens they adopted.

The question is about the Doubtfire sisters who have adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Then their mom calls to say that their two housecats have given birth to kittens. The first cat, Patchy, has three times as many kittens as the adopted ones, and the other cat, Trixie, has 12 kittens. The question is asking how many kittens the Doubtfires have now.\n\nAlright, so first, let me break down the information. The sisters already have 7 adopted kittens. Then, their two housecats, Patchy and Trixie, have each given birth to some kittens. The total number of kittens they have now would be the original 7 plus the new ones from Patchy and Trixie.\n\nThe problem says Patchy has three times as many kittens as the adopted ones. Wait, the adopted ones are the 7 kittens they took from the shelter. So does that mean Patchy has 3 times 7? Let me check that again. The wording is: \"Patchy, the first cat, three times as many kittens as the adopted, while Trixie, the other cat 12 brought to the world.\" So yes, \"as the adopted\" refers to the 7 adopted kittens. So Patchy's kittens are 3 * 7 = 21. Then Trixie has 12. So total new kittens are 21 + 12 = 33. Then adding the original 7, that would be 7 + 33 = 40. So the total number of kittens they have now is 40?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret. The problem says \"die adoptierten, während Trixie... 12 zur Welt gebracht hat.\" So \"die adoptierten\" refers to the 7 kittens they adopted. So Patchy has three times as many as the adopted ones, which are 7. So 3*7=21. Then Trixie has 12. So total new kittens are 21+12=33. Then adding the original 7, total is 7+33=40.

The delivery was done by a delivery service, so they added a 25% fee on the final bill and also charged $3.00 for delivery. Plus, Stephen gave a $4.00 tip. The question is asking for the final price after all these extra charges.\n\nWait, first I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. The original total was $40.00. Then, the delivery service added a 25% fee on top of that, and also a $3.00 delivery fee. Then Stephen added a $4.00 tip. So, the total would be the original amount plus the 25% fee, plus the $3 delivery fee, plus the $4 tip?\n\nBut wait, the wording says \"they have added a 25% fee on the final bill and charged $3.00 delivery fee.\" Hmm, maybe the 25% is on the original $40, and then the $3 is separate? Or is the 25% fee on the final bill after adding the $3 delivery fee? The wording is a bit ambiguous here.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"Da die Lieferung von einem Lieferdienstleister getätigt wurde, haben sie auf die Endabrechnung eine Gebühr von 25 % aufgeschlagen und ihm 3,00 US-Dollar Liefergebühr berechnet.\" So, \"they added a 25% fee on the final bill and charged him $3.00 delivery fee.\" So, the 25% is on the original final bill (which was $40), and then they added $3.00 delivery fee. Then Stephen gave a $4 tip. So, the total would be original $40 + 25% of $40 + $3 + $4?\n\nWait, but the original final bill was $40. So, the 25% fee is on that $40. So 25% of 40 is 10. So that would be $10. Then the delivery fee is $3. Then the tip is $4. So total would be 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 57?\n\nBut maybe the 25% is on the final bill after adding the delivery fee? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me check the original German again: \"haben sie auf die Endabrechnung eine Gebühr von 25 % aufgeschlagen und ihm 3,00 US-Dollar Liefergebühr berechnet.\" So \"on the final bill, they added a 25% fee and charged him $3 delivery fee.\" So the 25% is on the original final bill (which was $40), and then the $3 is an additional fee. So the 25% is calculated on the original $40, then the $3 is added, then the tip.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 25% is on the total after adding the delivery fee? But the way it's phrased, \"auf die Endabrechnung\" which is \"on the final bill\" (the original $40). So the 25% is on the original $40, then the delivery fee is $3, then the tip is $4. So total would be 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 57.\n\nBut let me think again. If the original final bill was $40, and then they added a 25% fee on that, so 40 * 1.25 = 50.

Stephen ordered some groceries online, and the final bill was $40.00. But then there were some extra charges. The delivery was done by a delivery service, so they added a 25% fee on the final bill and also charged $3.00 for delivery. Plus, Stephen gave a $4.00 tip. The question is asking for the final price after all these extra charges.\n\nWait, first I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. The original total was $40.00. Then, the delivery service added a 25% fee on top of that, and also a $3.00 delivery fee. Then Stephen added a $4.00 tip. So, the total would be the original amount plus the 25% fee, plus the $3 delivery fee, plus the $4 tip?\n\nBut wait, the wording says \"they have added a 25% fee on the final bill and charged $3.00 delivery fee.\" Hmm, maybe the 25% is on the original $40, and then the $3 is separate? Or is the 25% fee on the final bill after adding the $3 delivery fee? The wording is a bit ambiguous here.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"Da die Lieferung von einem Lieferdienstleister getätigt wurde, haben sie auf die Endabrechnung eine Gebühr von 25 % aufgeschlagen und ihm 3,00 US-Dollar Liefergebühr berechnet.\" So, \"they added a 25% fee on the final bill and charged him $3.00 delivery fee.\" So, the 25% is on the original final bill (which was $40), and then they added $3.00 delivery fee. Then Stephen gave a $4 tip. So, the total would be original $40 + 25% of $40 + $3 + $4?\n\nWait, but the original final bill was $40. So, the 25% fee is on that $40. So 25% of 40 is 10. So that would be $10. Then the delivery fee is $3. Then the tip is $4. So total would be 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 57?\n\nBut maybe the 25% is on the final bill after adding the delivery fee? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me check the original German again: \"haben sie auf die Endabrechnung eine Gebühr von 25 % aufgeschlagen und ihm 3,00 US-Dollar Liefergebühr berechnet.\" So \"on the final bill, they added a 25% fee and charged him $3 delivery fee.\" So the 25% is on the original final bill (which was $40), and then the $3 is an additional fee. So the 25% is calculated on the original $40, then the $3 is added, then the tip.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 25% is on the total after adding the delivery fee? But the way it's phrased, \"auf die Endabrechnung\" which is \"on the final bill\" (the original $40). So the 25% is on the original $40, then the delivery fee is $3, then the tip is $4. So total would be 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 57.\n\nBut let me think again. If the original final bill was $40, and then they added a 25% fee on that, so 40 * 1.25 = 50. Then they also added $3 delivery fee, making it 50 + 3 = 53, and then the tip is $4, so total 57. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if the 25% is on the total after adding the delivery fee, but the problem says \"auf die Endabrechnung\" which was $40. So the 25% is on the original $40. So the steps are:\n\nOriginal total: $40\n\n25% fee: 40 * 0.25 = $10\n\nDelivery fee: $3\n\nTip: $4\n\nTotal: 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = $57.\n\nYes, that seems to be the case.

The bad one is straightforward—1 orange. Then 20% are unripe. Hmm, 20% of 25. Let me calculate that. 20% is 0.2 in decimal, so 0.2 times 25. That would be 5 oranges.

Now, the question is, if she leaves after 30 years, what is her annual pension then?\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the structure of her pension. The problem says that after 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the annual pension per year. Wait, does that mean that after 20 years, her pension increases by 5% annually? Or is it a one-time 5% addition? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Nach 20 Jahren werden ihr 5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" Translating that: \"After 20 years, she is granted 5% of the value of the annual pension per year.\" So, maybe after 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of the annual pension each year? Or is it that the pension itself becomes 5% of the original value? That part is confusing.\n\nWait, the original pension is $50,000 per year. If after 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the annual pension per year, does that mean her pension increases by 5% annually starting from year 20? Or is it that after 20 years, she receives 5% of the original pension amount each year? That would be $2,500 per year. But that seems too low. Alternatively, maybe the pension is calculated as 5% of the value of the annual pension, which would be 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500. But then, if she leaves after 30 years, would that be added to her original pension?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Nach 20 Jahren werden ihr 5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, after 20 years, she is granted 5% of the value of the annual pension per year. So, if the annual pension is $50,000, then 5% of that is $2,500. So, does that mean that after 20 years, she gets an additional $2,500 per year? So her total pension would be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 per year?\n\nBut then, if she leaves after 30 years, does that mean she gets the same $52,500? Or is there a different calculation? Wait, maybe the 5% is not an addition but a multiplier. Like, after 20 years, her pension is 5% of the original value. But that would be $2,500, which seems low. Alternatively, maybe the pension is calculated based on the number of years worked, and after 20 years, she gets 5% more each year. But the problem states \"5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, 5% of the annual pension value per year. That might mean that each year after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension. But that would be $2,500 per year, added to her original $50,000. So total $52,500.\n\nBut then, if she leaves after 30 years, does that mean she gets the same $52,500? Or is there a different calculation? Wait, maybe the pension is calculated based on the number of years worked. For example, if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. But after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension. So, maybe the pension is calculated as follows: for the first 20 years, she gets $50,000, and after that, she gets 5% more each year. But that would be $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500. So, if she leaves after 30 years, she would get $52,500 per year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5% is a one-time addition after 20 years. But the wording says \"pro Jahr\" which is \"per year,\" so it's an annual amount. So, after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension each year. So, that would be $2,500 per year added to her original $50,000, making it $52,500. Therefore, if she leaves after 30 years, her annual pension would be $52,500.\n\nWait, but maybe the pension is calculated based on the number of years worked. For example, if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. But after 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the annual pension. So, maybe the pension is calculated as $50,000 plus 5% of $50,000 for each year after 20 years. But that would be $50,000 + 5% * $50,000 * (number of years after 20). But she leaves after 30 years, so that's 10 years after 20. So, $50,000 + 5% * $50,000 * 10 = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000. But that seems like a lot. However, the problem says \"5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, 5% of the annual pension per year. If the annual pension is $50,000, then 5% of that is $2,500 per year. So, if she works for 30 years, she gets $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500. But that would be the same as if she left after 20 years. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the 5% is applied annually after 20 years. So, starting from year 21, her pension increases by 5% each year. So, year 21: $50,000 * 1.05, year 22: $50,000 * 1.05^2, etc. Then, after 30 years, it would be $50,000 * 1.05^(10) = $50,000 * 1.62889 = $81,444.50. But the problem says \"5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, maybe it's a one-time 5% addition after 20 years, not a compounding increase. That is, after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension, which is $2,500, so total $52,500. Then, if she leaves after 30 years, she still gets $52,500. But that seems too simple. However, the problem might be that after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension, which is $2,500, so her total pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

But maybe the 5% is applied annually after 20 years. So, each year after 20, she gets 5% more. So, year 21: 5% of $50,000 = $2,500, year 22: another 5% of $50,000, etc. But that would be $2,500 per year added each year after 20. So, after 30 years, she has 10 years of 5% additions, so $2,500 * 10 = $25,000 added to the original $50,000, making it $75,000. But that seems like a lot.

Therefore, if she leaves after 30 years, her pension is $52,500. But the problem might be more complex. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Wenn Marcy 40 Jahre lang für das gleiche Unternehmen tätig ist, bekommt sie eine jährliche Rente von 50.000 US-Dollar/Jahr.

Therefore, regardless of when she leaves after 20 years, she gets $52,500. So, if she leaves after 30 years, it's still $52,500. That seems to be the answer.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me think again. If she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. But after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension. So, maybe the pension is calculated based on the number of years worked. For example, if she works for 20 years, she gets some amount, and after that, it increases by 5% per year. But the problem states that if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. So, maybe the $50,000 is the pension after 40 years. But the question is about if she leaves after 30 years, what is her pension. So, perhaps the pension is calculated as a function of years worked. For example, if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. If she works for 30 years, maybe it's less. But the problem says that after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension.

Aleena has a streaming service that costs $140 per month. The question is about calculating the total she'll pay by the end of the year, considering that the first half of the year is charged at the original rate, and the second half is 10% less. Hmm, okay, so first I need to break down the year into two halves. A year has 12 months, so half a year would be 6 months each. \n\nSo for the first 6 months, she pays the full $140 each month. Then for the next 6 months, the price is reduced by 10%. I need to calculate the total for each half and then add them together. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst half: 6 months at $140 per month. That would be 6 multiplied by 140. Let me do that calculation. 6 times 140... Well, 10 times 140 is 1400, so 6 times 140 is 840. So that's $840 for the first half.\n\nNow the second half. The price is 10% less than the original. So 10% of $140 is... 10% of 140 is 14. So subtracting that from 140 gives 140 - 14 = $126 per month for the second half. Then, again, 6 months at $126. Let me calculate that. 6 times 126. Hmm, 6 times 100 is 600, 6 times 20 is 120, and 6 times 6 is 36. Adding those together: 600 + 120 = 720, plus 36 is 756. So the second half is $756.\n\nNow, adding both halves together: $840 (first half) + $756 (second half). Let's add those. 800 + 700 is 1500, 40 + 56 is 96. So total is 1500 + 96 = $1596. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 840 + 756. Breaking it down: 800 + 700 = 1500, 40 + 50 = 90, 6 + 6 = 12. Wait, that would be 1500 + 90 + 12 = 1602? Wait, no, maybe I messed up the breakdown. Let me do it more carefully. 840 + 756. Let's add 800 + 700 = 1500, then 40 + 50 = 90, and 0 + 6 = 6. So 1500 + 90 = 1590, plus 6 is 1596. Yes, that's correct. So total is $1596.\n\nAlternatively, I can check using another method. 840 + 756. Let's add 840 + 700 = 1540, then add 56: 1540 + 56 = 1596. Yep, same result. So that seems right.\n\nSo the total amount Aleena will pay by the end of the year is $1596. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the percentage calculation. The second half is 10% less, so 10% of 140 is indeed 14, so 140 - 14 = 126. Then 6 months at 126 is 756. That seems correct. And the first half is straightforward 6*140=840.

Hmm, I need to figure out the miles per gallon first, right?\n\nWait, so if she drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons, that means her car's fuel efficiency is 100 miles divided by 4 gallons.

The question is about four schools participating in a basketball tournament. Each school has a girls' team and a boys' team, and each team has 5 players. Also, each school has sent a coach for each team. The question is asking how many people in total the schools have sent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the problem step by step. Let me start by considering one school first and then multiply by four since there are four schools.\n\nSo, for one school: they have two teams, a girls' and a boys' team. Each team has 5 players. That's 5 players for the girls and 5 for the boys, so 5 + 5 = 10 players per school. Then, each team also has a coach. So, that's one coach for the girls' team and one for the boys' team. That adds 2 coaches per school.\n\nSo, per school, the total number of people is players plus coaches. That would be 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people per school.\n\nNow, since there are four schools, I need to multiply the number of people per school by 4. So, 12 people per school times 4 schools. Let me calculate that: 12 * 4 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Each school has two teams, each with 5 players. So 2 teams * 5 players = 10 players. Then, two coaches, one for each team. So 2 coaches. So 10 + 2 = 12 per school. Four schools: 12 * 4 = 48. That seems right.\n\nBut hold on, is there a possibility that the coaches are counted differently? Like, maybe each coach is only for one team, so two coaches per school. Yes, that's what the question says: \"jeder Schule hat einen Trainer für jedes Team mitgeschickt.\" So \"each school has sent a coach for each team.\" So each team has one coach, so two coaches per school.

The question is about four schools participating in a basketball tournament. Each school has a girls' team and a boys' team, and each team has 5 players. Also, each school has sent a coach for each team. The question is asking how many people in total the schools have sent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the problem step by step. Let me start by considering one school first and then multiply by four since there are four schools.\n\nSo, for one school: they have two teams, a girls' and a boys' team. Each team has 5 players. That's 5 players for the girls and 5 for the boys, so 5 + 5 = 10 players per school. Then, each team also has a coach. So, that's one coach for the girls' team and one for the boys' team. That adds 2 coaches per school.\n\nSo, per school, the total number of people is players plus coaches. That would be 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people per school.\n\nNow, since there are four schools, I need to multiply the number of people per school by 4. So, 12 people per school times 4 schools. Let me calculate that: 12 * 4 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Each school has two teams, each with 5 players. So 2 teams * 5 players = 10 players. Then, two coaches, one for each team. So 2 coaches. So 10 + 2 = 12 per school. Four schools: 12 * 4 = 48. That seems right.\n\nBut hold on, is there a possibility that the coaches are counted differently? Like, maybe each coach is only for one team, so two coaches per school. Yes, that's what the question says: \"jeder Schule hat einen Trainer für jedes Team mitgeschickt.\" So \"each school has sent a coach for each team.\" So each team has one coach, so two coaches per school.

Like, is the 2% per month or per the entire period? The question says \"Pro Stück werden 2 % Zinsen verlangt.\" So, per piece, 2% interest. But does that mean 2% per month or 2% total over the three months? The wording is a bit unclear. If it's 2% per month, then the calculation would be different. But the problem says \"Ratenzahlungsvertrag über 3 Monate\" which is a payment plan over 3 months. So, maybe the 2% is the total interest for the entire period, not per month. That would make sense. So, 2% of the total amount. Wait, but the question says \"Pro Stück werden 2 % Zinsen verlangt.\" So, per piece, 2% interest. So, per phone, 2% interest. So, if each phone is $150, then 2% of that is $3, as I calculated before. So total interest is $15, total amount $765, divided by 3 months is $255 per month. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe the interest is compounded monthly? Wait, the problem doesn't mention compounding. It just says 2% per piece. So, maybe it's simple interest.

But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, if the 2% is per month, then the interest would be calculated each month. But that would be more complicated. For example, if it's 2% per month on the principal. But the question says \"Pro Stück werden 2 % Zinsen verlangt.\" So, per piece, 2% interest.

So, for each flower type, I need to determine what the next whole dollar amount is.\n\nStarting with Marigolds: $2.74. The next whole dollar after 2.74 is $3.00 because 2.74 is more than $2.00 but less than $3.00, so rounding up would be $3.\n\nPetunias: $1.87. Similarly, the next whole dollar is $2.00. Even though 1.87 is close to $2, since he's rounding up, it's $2.\n\nBegonias: $2.12. The next whole dollar is $3.00? Wait, no. Wait, $2.12 is between $2 and $3. So rounding up would be $3? Wait, but if the price is $2.12, the next higher dollar is $3? Or is it $2.00? Wait, no. Wait, rounding up to the next dollar. So if the price is $2.12, the next dollar is $3.00? Because $2.12 is more than $2.00, so the next whole dollar is $3.00. But wait, sometimes people might think of rounding to the nearest dollar, but the question says \"nächsthöheren Dollarbetrag\", which translates to \"next higher dollar amount\", so it's always rounding up to the next whole dollar, regardless of the cents. So even if it's $2.01, it would be rounded up to $3.00? Wait, no. Wait, if you have $2.01, the next higher dollar is $3.00? Or is it $2.00? Wait, no. If you have $2.01, the next higher dollar would be $3.00? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the question is that he rounds up to the nearest whole dollar, meaning if it's $2.01, it becomes $3.00? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe the question is that he rounds up to the next whole dollar, meaning if the price is not a whole number, he rounds it up to the next whole number. So for example, $2.74 would be $3.00, $1.87 would be $2.00, and $2.12 would be $3.00? Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal prices:\n\n- Marigolds: $2.74.

Wait, $2.12 is between $2 and $3. So if you round up to the next whole dollar, it's $3.00. But that seems like a big jump. But the question says \"nächsthöheren Dollarbetrag\", which is \"next higher dollar amount\". So if the price is not a whole number, you round up to the next whole number. So even if it's $2.01, it would be $3.00? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the question is that he rounds up to the nearest dollar, but if it's already a whole number, he leaves it as is. But the original prices are not whole numbers. So for example, $2.74 is not a whole number, so he rounds up to $3.00. $1.87 is not a whole number, so he rounds up to $2.00. $2.12 is not a whole number, so he rounds up to $3.00. Wait, but $2.12 is only 12 cents over $2.00, so rounding up to $3.00 would be a $0.88 increase. That seems like a lot. But maybe that's what the question says. Let me check the original question again.\n\n\"Er verkauft normalerweise Ringelblumen für 2,74 US-Dollar pro Topf, Petunien für 1,87 US-Dollar pro Topf und Begonien für 2,12 US-Dollar pro Topf.

So for each price, regardless of how close it is to the next dollar, he rounds up. So $2.74 becomes $3.00, $1.87 becomes $2.00, $2.12 becomes $3.00. That seems correct according to the wording.\n\nSo then, the new prices are:\n\n- Marigolds: $3.00 per pot\n\n- Petunias: $2.00 per pot\n\n- Begonias: $3.00 per pot\n\nWait, but Begonias are $2.12, which is $2.12.

So even though it's only 12 cents over $2, he still rounds up to $3. So that's how it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe \"nächsthöheren Dollarbetrag\" is meant to be the nearest dollar, but if it's exactly halfway, round up. But the question says \"aufzurunden\", which is \"to round up\", so it's definitely rounding up to the next whole dollar, not rounding to the nearest. So even if it's $2.01, it becomes $3.00.

Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the area of each level. Since each level is half the one below, starting from the top. Wait, the top level is 16, so the one below it must be double that, right? Because each level is half the one below. So if the top is 16, the second level from the top would be 32. Then the third level would be 64, and the bottom one would be 128? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"jede Ebene einer Sandburg nur halb so viele Quadratmeter hat wie die darunterliegende Ebene.\" So each level is half the area of the one below it. So the level above is half the one below. So if the top level is 16, then the level below it (second level) is 16 * 2 = 32. Then the third level is 32 * 2 = 64, and the fourth level (the bottom one) is 64 * 2 = 128. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo the four levels are 16, 32, 64, 128.

Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the area of each level. Since each level is half the one below, starting from the top. Wait, the top level is 16, so the one below it must be double that, right? Because each level is half the one below. So if the top is 16, the second level from the top would be 32. Then the third level would be 64, and the bottom one would be 128? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"jede Ebene einer Sandburg nur halb so viele Quadratmeter hat wie die darunterliegende Ebene.\" So each level is half the area of the one below it. So the level above is half the one below. So if the top level is 16, then the level below it (second level) is 16 * 2 = 32. Then the third level is 32 * 2 = 64, and the fourth level (the bottom one) is 64 * 2 = 128. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo the four levels are 16, 32, 64, 128.

Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers, and he can choose between two different packaging options. The first option is 3-packs for $2.50 each, and the second is 2-packs for $1 each. The question is asking how much money he can save by buying the 18 flowers at the better price. Hmm, so I need to figure out which package is cheaper per flower and then calculate the total cost for 18 flowers using that package, and then compare it to the other option to find the savings.\n\nFirst, maybe I should find out the price per flower for each package. That way, I can see which one is cheaper. Let's start with the 3-packs. Each 3-pack costs $2.50, so the price per flower would be $2.50 divided by 3. Let me calculate that: 2.50 / 3. Hmm, 2.50 divided by 3 is approximately 0.8333 dollars per flower. So about 83.33 cents per flower.\n\nNow for the 2-packs. Each 2-pack is $1, so the price per flower is $1 divided by 2, which is $0.50 per flower. That's 50 cents per flower. So clearly, the 2-packs are cheaper per flower. Therefore, Vincent should buy as many 2-packs as possible to save money.\n\nBut wait, he needs exactly 18 flowers. Let me check if 18 can be divided evenly by 2. Yes, 18 divided by 2 is 9. So he can buy 9 packs of 2, which would give him exactly 18 flowers. The total cost would be 9 packs times $1 each, which is $9.00.\n\nBut let me also check the other option just to be sure. If he buys 3-packs, how many would he need? 18 divided by 3 is 6. So 6 packs of 3. Each pack is $2.50, so 6 times 2.50 is... 6*2 is 12, and 6*0.50 is 3, so total $15.00. So buying 3-packs would cost $15, while buying 2-packs costs $9. The difference is $15 - $9 = $6. So he saves $6 by buying the 2-packs.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a combination of both packages that could be cheaper? Let me think. For example, if he buys some 3-packs and some 2-packs to get exactly 18 flowers. But since 18 is divisible by both 2 and 3, maybe not necessary. But just to check, suppose he buys 5 packs of 3, which is 15 flowers, and then 1 pack of 2, which is 2 flowers. That would be 17 flowers. Then he needs one more flower. But he can't buy a single flower, only in packs. So he would have to buy another 2-pack, making it 19 flowers. That would be 5*3 + 2*2 = 15 + 4 = 19 flowers. The cost would be 5*2.50 + 2*1 = 12.50 + 2 = $14.50. Which is more than $9, so worse than buying all 2-packs. Alternatively, if he buys 6 packs of 3 (18 flowers) for $15, which is more than $9. So definitely, buying all 2-packs is cheaper.\n\nAlternatively, if he buys 8 packs of 2 (16 flowers) and then one 2-pack is 16, but he needs 18. So 8 packs of 2 is 16, then he needs 2 more, which is another 2-pack. So that's 9 packs total, which is 18 flowers. So that's the same as before. So no, there's no cheaper way than buying all 2-packs. Therefore, the savings are $15 - $9 = $6.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the per-flower cost again. The 2-pack is $1 for 2 flowers, so $0.50 per flower. The 3-pack is $2.50 for 3 flowers, which is approximately $0.833 per flower. So yes, the 2-pack is cheaper. Therefore, buying all 2-packs is the better deal. So the total cost is $9, and the other option is $15, so the saving is $6. That seems right.\n\nI think that's the answer. But let me just check once more. 18 flowers in 2-packs: 18 divided by 2 is 9. 9 times $1 is $9. 18 flowers in 3-packs: 18 divided by 3 is 6. 6 times $2.50 is $15. Difference is $6. Yep, that's correct.

But just to check, suppose he buys 5 packs of 3, which is 15 flowers, and then 1 pack of 2, which is 2 flowers. That would be 17 flowers. Then he needs one more flower. But he can't buy a single flower, only in packs. So he would have to buy another 2-pack, making it 19 flowers. That would be 5*3 + 2*2 = 15 + 4 = 19 flowers. The cost would be 5*2.50 + 2*1 = 12.50 + 2 = $14.50. Which is more than $9, so worse than buying all 2-packs. Alternatively, if he buys 6 packs of 3 (18 flowers) for $15, which is more than $9. So definitely, buying all 2-packs is cheaper.\n\nAlternatively, if he buys 8 packs of 2 (16 flowers) and then one 2-pack is 16, but he needs 18. So 8 packs of 2 is 16, then he needs 2 more, which is another 2-pack. So that's 9 packs total, which is 18 flowers. So that's the same as before. So no, there's no cheaper way than buying all 2-packs. Therefore, the savings are $15 - $9 = $6.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the per-flower cost again. The 2-pack is $1 for 2 flowers, so $0.50 per flower. The 3-pack is $2.50 for 3 flowers, which is approximately $0.833 per flower. So yes, the 2-pack is cheaper. Therefore, buying all 2-packs is the better deal. So the total cost is $9, and the other option is $15, so the saving is $6. That seems right.\n\nI think that's the answer. But let me just check once more. 18 flowers in 2-packs: 18 divided by 2 is 9. 9 times $1 is $9. 18 flowers in 3-packs: 18 divided by 3 is 6. 6 times $2.50 is $15. Difference is $6. Yep, that's correct. So Vincent saves $6 by buying the 2-packs instead of the 3-packs.\n</think>\n\nVincent kann 18 Blumen entweder in 2-er-Packungen (je 1,00 $) oder in 3-er-Packungen (je 2,50 $) kaufen. \n\n**Berechnung des günstigsten Preises:**\n- **2-er-Packungen:**  \n  Für 18 Blumen benötigt er $ \\frac{18}{2} = 9 $ Packungen.  \n  Gesamtkosten: $ 9 \\times 1,00 = 9,00 $ $.\n\n- **3-er-Packungen:**  \n  Für 18 Blumen benötigt er $ \\frac{18}{3} = 6 $ Packungen.  \n  Gesamtkosten: $ 6 \\times 2,50 = 15,00 $ $.\n\n**Ersparnis:**  \n$ 15,00 - 9,00 = 6,00 $ $.\n\n**Antwort:** Vincent spart **6,00 US-Dollar**."], "doc_hash": "906f7400201a8ab5bb1fa82731f55ea80fe396f02c826798046977c6e024448c", "prompt_hash": "cf98496c219f92ca1678e63ccc25f882232547fe14c3ebf0dcf8e3bab3f19754", "target_hash": "e7f6c011776e8db7cd330b54174fd76f7d0216b612387a5ffcfb81e6f0919683", "exact_match": 0.0}

So there are 75 roses in total.\n\nNow, each of those roses has 8 thorns. So to get the total number of thorns, I need to multiply the number of roses by the number of thorns per rose.

So the total number of thorns should be 600.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3 bushes times 25 roses each is definitely 75 roses. Then 75 roses times 8 thorns each. Yeah, 75*8. Another way to think about it is 75*8 = (70 + 5)*8 = 70*8 + 5*8 = 560 + 40 = 600. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I missed any steps here.

Let me denote the number of losses as L. Then, according to the problem, the number of wins is 8 more than the number of losses. So, if I let W represent the number of wins, then W = L + 8.\n\nSince the total games are the sum of wins and losses, I can write the equation: W + L = 22.

The second time, it rang three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang half as long as the second time. The question is, how many times did the alarm ring in total?\n\nHmm, wait. The problem mentions \"how often the alarm has rung\" in total. But the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nFirst, when the alarm went off the first time, it rang four times. So that's four rings. Then, the second time it went off, it rang three times as long as the first time. Wait, does that mean the duration was three times longer, or the number of rings was three times? The original says \"dreimal so lange geklingelt wie beim ersten Mal.\" \"So lange\" means \"as long,\" so the duration. So the second time, the alarm rang for three times the duration of the first time. But how does that translate to the number of rings?\n\nWait, but the first time, it rang four times. If the duration is three times longer, but the number of rings depends on the duration. If the alarm rings at a certain frequency, say, once per second, then longer duration would mean more rings. But the problem doesn't specify the frequency. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using \"klingelt\" in the sense of the number of times it rings, not the duration. Let me check the original German again: \"Als er heute zum ersten Mal losging, hat er viermal geklingelt.\" So \"viermal geklingelt\" means \"rang four times.\" Then, \"beim zweiten Mal... dreimal so lange geklingelt wie beim ersten Mal.\" \"So lange\" is duration, but maybe in this context, it's being used to mean the number of times? That might be a translation issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"so lange\" here refers to the number of rings. For example, if the first time it rang four times, the second time it rang three times as long, meaning three times the number of rings. But that would be \"dreimal so oft geklingelt,\" not \"so lange.\" Hmm.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me think again. If the alarm rings for a certain duration each time, and the number of rings depends on the duration. But without knowing the rate (how many rings per second), we can't calculate the exact number. However, maybe the problem is using \"so lange\" to mean the number of rings. For example, if the first time it rang four times, the second time it rang three times as long, meaning three times the number of rings, so 4 * 3 = 12 rings. Then the third time, half as long as the second time, so 12 / 2 = 6 rings. Total would be 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 rings.\n\nBut that's assuming that \"so lange\" refers to the number of rings, which might not be accurate. Alternatively, if \"so lange\" refers to duration, but the number of rings is proportional to the duration. However, without knowing the rate, we can't compute the exact number. But maybe the problem is using \"so lange\" to mean the number of rings, even though that's not the standard usage. In that case, the answer would be 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in German, and \"so lange\" is being used in a way that's equivalent to \"so oft\" (so often). Maybe a translation error. If that's the case, then the answer would be 22. But I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the duration, but the number of rings is the same each time. Wait, but the first time it rang four times, so maybe each time it rings four times, but the duration is different. But that doesn't make sense. If the alarm rings for a certain duration, the number of rings would depend on how long it rings. For example, if it rings once per second, then a longer duration would mean more rings. But without knowing the rate, we can't calculate. However, maybe the problem is assuming that the number of rings is the same as the duration in some unit. For example, if the first time it rang for four seconds, with one ring per second, so four rings. Then the second time, three times as long, so 12 seconds, hence 12 rings. Third time, half as long as the second, so 6 seconds, 6 rings. Total 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.\n\nBut this is making an assumption about the rate. However, given that the first time it's stated as \"viermal geklingelt,\" which is four times, and if we take that as the number of rings, then the second time being three times as long would mean three times the number of rings. So that would be 4 * 3 = 12, and third time half of that, 6. Total 22.\n\nAlternatively, if \"so lange\" refers to the duration, but the number of rings is fixed, but that doesn't make sense because the first time it rang four times, so maybe the duration is four units, and the second time three times longer, so 12 units, but the number of rings would still be four? That seems odd.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but in typical math problems, when they say something like \"three times as long,\" and the first time is four rings, they might be implying that the number of rings is three times as many.

Third time, half as long as the second, so 6 seconds, 6 rings. Total 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.\n\nBut this is making an assumption about the rate. However, given that the first time it's stated as \"viermal geklingelt,\" which is four times, and if we take that as the number of rings, then the second time being three times as long would mean three times the number of rings. So that would be 4 * 3 = 12, and third time half of that, 6. Total 22.\n\nAlternatively, if \"so lange\" refers to the duration, but the number of rings is fixed, but that doesn't make sense because the first time it rang four times, so maybe the duration is four units, and the second time three times longer, so 12 units, but the number of rings would still be four? That seems odd.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but in typical math problems, when they say something like \"three times as long,\" and the first time is four rings, they might be implying that the number of rings is three times as many. So I think the answer is 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.\n</think>\n\nGreg's Wecker klingelt insgesamt **22 Mal**. \n\n**Berechnung:**  \n- **Erster Weckruf:** 4 Mal.  \n- **Zweiter Weckruf:** Dreimal so lange wie der erste → $4 \\times 3 = 12$ Mal.  \n- **Dritter Weckruf:** Halb so lange wie der zweite → $12 \\div 2 = 6$ Mal.  \n\n**Gesamt:** $4 + 12 + 6 = 22$.  \n\n**Antwort:** $\\boxed{22}$"], "doc_hash": "5135e12183ea030b75f7e04cf2b0905c6349c0570b3628dcb5dcca43f0c69380", "prompt_hash": "e26af1b979e86229d2aba080d73b79baa45927560bcbaa501414066bf9d8fdd1", "target_hash": "785f3ec7eb32f30b90cd0fcf3657d388b5ff4297f2f9716ff66e9b69c05ddd09", "exact_match": 0.0}

Now, we need to find her salary after three more years. So, three years after she had five years of service. That would mean she has 5 + 3 = 8 years of service now. But does the salary increase happen once when she reaches five years, and then remains the same? Or does it increase every year after that?\n\nThe policy says \"für diejenigen angehoben wird, die seit fünf Jahren im Unternehmen sind.\" So, the increase is applied to those who have been with the company for five years.

So, her salary after the increase would be $600 + 10% of $600 = $600 * 1.10 = $660 per month.

Christina is planning a birthday party and needs to figure out how much she'll spend on gift bags. The problem says she needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest because 1/4 of the guests won't show up. She invited 16 friends, and each gift bag costs $2. So, I need to calculate the total cost.\n\nFirst, I need to determine how many guests will actually attend. Since 1/4 of the guests aren't coming, that means 3/4 will come. Wait, the problem says she needs 0.75 gift bags per guest because 1/4 don't come. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. If 1/4 of the guests don't come, then she needs to prepare gift bags for the ones who do come. But the problem states she needs 0.75 per guest. Maybe that's because she's accounting for the no-shows by preparing fewer bags? Or is it that she needs 0.75 bags per guest, regardless of attendance? Wait, the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nLet me read it again: \"für jeden eingeladenen Gast 0,75 Geschenktüten, da 1/4 der Gäste nicht erscheint.\" So, \"for each invited guest 0.75 gift bags, because 1/4 of the guests don't come.\" So, maybe she's calculating that since 1/4 don't come, she needs 0.75 bags per invited guest. Wait, 1/4 is 0.25, so maybe she's adjusting the number of bags by that fraction? Let me think.\n\nIf she invited 16 guests, and 1/4 don't come, that's 16 * 1/4 = 4 guests not coming. So, 16 - 4 = 12 guests attending. If she needs to prepare gift bags for the attendees, that would be 12 bags. But the problem says she needs 0.75 bags per invited guest. So, 16 guests * 0.75 = 12 bags. Oh, that's the same as the other way. So, whether she calculates 1/4 of the guests not coming (so 3/4 attending) or multiplies the number of invited guests by 0.75, she gets 12. So, that's the number of gift bags needed.\n\nThen, each gift bag costs $2, so total cost is 12 * $2 = $24. So, the answer should be $24. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0.75 is because she needs to have some extra? But the problem says \"da 1/4 der Gäste nicht erscheint,\" which translates to \"because 1/4 of the guests don't come.\" So, she needs to prepare fewer bags than the number of invited guests. Since 1/4 don't come, she needs to prepare 3/4 of the invited guests' number. 3/4 is 0.75, so 16 * 0.75 = 12. Then 12 * $2 = $24. That seems right.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's another interpretation.

Christina is planning a birthday party and needs to figure out how much she'll spend on gift bags. The problem says she needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest because 1/4 of the guests won't show up. She invited 16 friends, and each gift bag costs $2. So, I need to calculate the total cost.\n\nFirst, I need to determine how many guests will actually attend. Since 1/4 of the guests aren't coming, that means 3/4 will come. Wait, the problem says she needs 0.75 gift bags per guest because 1/4 don't come. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. If 1/4 of the guests don't come, then she needs to prepare gift bags for the ones who do come. But the problem states she needs 0.75 per guest. Maybe that's because she's accounting for the no-shows by preparing fewer bags? Or is it that she needs 0.75 bags per guest, regardless of attendance? Wait, the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nLet me read it again: \"für jeden eingeladenen Gast 0,75 Geschenktüten, da 1/4 der Gäste nicht erscheint.\" So, \"for each invited guest 0.75 gift bags, because 1/4 of the guests don't come.\" So, maybe she's calculating that since 1/4 don't come, she needs 0.75 bags per invited guest. Wait, 1/4 is 0.25, so maybe she's adjusting the number of bags by that fraction? Let me think.\n\nIf she invited 16 guests, and 1/4 don't come, that's 16 * 1/4 = 4 guests not coming. So, 16 - 4 = 12 guests attending. If she needs to prepare gift bags for the attendees, that would be 12 bags. But the problem says she needs 0.75 bags per invited guest. So, 16 guests * 0.75 = 12 bags. Oh, that's the same as the other way. So, whether she calculates 1/4 of the guests not coming (so 3/4 attending) or multiplies the number of invited guests by 0.75, she gets 12. So, that's the number of gift bags needed.\n\nThen, each gift bag costs $2, so total cost is 12 * $2 = $24. So, the answer should be $24. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0.75 is because she needs to have some extra? But the problem says \"da 1/4 der Gäste nicht erscheint,\" which translates to \"because 1/4 of the guests don't come.\" So, she needs to prepare fewer bags than the number of invited guests. Since 1/4 don't come, she needs to prepare 3/4 of the invited guests' number. 3/4 is 0.75, so 16 * 0.75 = 12. Then 12 * $2 = $24. That seems right.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's another interpretation. For example, if she needs 0.75 bags per guest, regardless of attendance, but that would be 16 * 0.75 = 12, same as before. So either way, the calculation leads to 12 bags.

The problem is about Lee and Gerald running the 400-meter hurdles. I need to figure out how fast Gerald can run now after improving his diet.

Now, Lee's time is 38 seconds. The question is, how fast can Gerald run now with his improved speed?\n\nHmm. Let me start by understanding the original times before Gerald's diet change. Let's denote Gerald's original time as G. Then Lee's original time would be G - 2 seconds, right? Because Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Lee's time is now 38 seconds. Wait, does that mean Lee's time is 38 seconds after Gerald's diet change? Or is that Lee's original time? The wording is a bit confusing here. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Lee konnte die 400 Meter Hürdenlauf zwei Sekunden schneller laufen als Gerald die 400 Meter Hürden läuft.

Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft, wie schnell kann dann Gerald, mit seiner verbesserten Ernährungsweise, die 400 Meter Hürden in Sekunden laufen?\"\n\nSo, the original statement is that Lee can run two seconds faster than Gerald. Then Gerald improved his speed by 10%. Now, Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, the 38 seconds is Lee's time after Gerald's improvement? Or is that Lee's original time?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft...\" which translates to \"If Lee runs the 400m hurdles in 38 seconds...\" So, this is Lee's current time. But when was Gerald's improvement? The problem says Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. So, the 38 seconds is Lee's time, and we need to find Gerald's time after his improvement.\n\nBut first, we need to figure out Gerald's original time. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet G be Gerald's original time (before diet change).\n\nThen Lee's original time would be G - 2 seconds.\n\nBut now, Gerald has improved his speed by 10%. So, his new time would be G * (1 - 0.10) = 0.9G? Wait, no. Wait, if speed increases by 10%, then time decreases. Because speed and time are inversely related. So, if speed increases by 10%, the time should decrease by a certain percentage.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Gerald hat seine Geschwindigkeit um 10 % verbessert\". So, his speed is now 1.1 times his original speed. Therefore, his time would be original time divided by 1.1, right? Because time is inversely proportional to speed.\n\nSo, if original speed is S, then new speed is 1.1S. Since time = distance / speed, original time is D/S, new time is D/(1.1S) = original time / 1.1. So, new time is original time multiplied by 1/1.1 ≈ 0.9091.\n\nBut the problem says Lee's time is 38 seconds. Wait, but when is that? Is Lee's time 38 seconds before or after Gerald's improvement? The problem says \"Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft...\" which is a hypothetical scenario. So, maybe Lee's time is 38 seconds, and we need to find Gerald's time after his improvement.\n\nBut how does that relate to the original statement that Lee was two seconds faster than Gerald?\n\nSo, originally, Lee's time was G - 2, where G is Gerald's original time. But now, Gerald has improved his speed, so his new time is G / 1.1. But Lee's time is now 38 seconds. Wait, but does Lee's time change? The problem doesn't say that Lee changed anything. So, maybe Lee's time is still G - 2, but the problem says that Lee's time is 38 seconds. Therefore, G - 2 = 38? Then G = 40 seconds. Then Gerald's original time was 40 seconds, and after improving his speed by 10%, his new time is 40 / 1.1 ≈ 36.36 seconds. So, the answer would be approximately 36.36 seconds, which is 36 and 4/11 seconds, or 36.36 seconds.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says Lee could run two seconds faster than Gerald. So, Lee's original time is Gerald's original time minus 2. Then, Gerald improves his speed by 10%, so his new time is original time divided by 1.1. Now, Lee's time is given as 38 seconds. But is that Lee's original time or his current time? The problem says \"Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft...\" which is a conditional statement. So, if Lee runs in 38 seconds, then what is Gerald's time? But does that mean that Lee's time is 38 seconds, which would be his original time? Or is there a change in Lee's time?\n\nWait, the problem doesn't mention Lee changing anything. So, if Lee's original time was G - 2, and now Lee's time is 38 seconds, then that would mean that G - 2 = 38, so G = 40. Therefore, Gerald's original time was 40 seconds. Then, after improving his speed by 10%, his new time is 40 / 1.1 ≈ 36.36 seconds. Therefore, the answer is approximately 36.36 seconds.\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't misinterpret the original relationship. The original statement is that Lee could run two seconds faster than Gerald. So, Lee's time is Gerald's time minus two. So, if Gerald's original time is G, Lee's original time is G - 2. Then, the problem says that Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, that would be Lee's original time? Or is that Lee's time after Gerald's improvement?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft...\" which is a hypothetical scenario. So, maybe Lee's time is 38 seconds, and we need to find Gerald's time after his improvement. But how does that relate to the original two seconds difference?\n\nWait, perhaps the original two seconds difference is still in effect. So, if Lee's time is 38 seconds, then Gerald's original time would be 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. Then, Gerald's improved time is 40 / 1.1 ≈ 36.36 seconds. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two seconds difference is after Gerald's improvement. But the problem says \"Lee konnte die 400 Meter Hürdenlauf zwei Sekunden schneller laufen als Gerald die 400 Meter Hürden läuft.\" So, the original statement is that Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald. Then Gerald improves his speed, and now we have Lee's time as 38 seconds. So, Lee's time hasn't changed, so Gerald's original time was 40 seconds, and after improvement, it's 40 / 1.1 ≈ 36.36 seconds.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 36.36 seconds, which can be written as 36.36 or as a fraction. Let me compute 40 divided by 1.1.\n\n40 / 1.1 = 400 / 11 ≈ 36.3636... So, approximately 36.36 seconds. Depending on how the answer should be presented, maybe as a fraction or decimal. The problem says \"in Sekunden\", so decimal is fine. But maybe they want it as a fraction. 400/11 is the exact value.\n\nBut let me check again. Let me rephrase the problem step by step.\n\n1. Original times: Lee's time = Gerald's original time - 2 seconds.\n\n2. Gerald improves his speed by 10%, so his new time is original time / 1.1.\n\n3. Now, Lee's time is given as 38 seconds. Assuming that Lee's time hasn't changed, then Lee's original time is 38 seconds. Therefore, from step 1: 38 = Gerald_original - 2 => Gerald_original = 40 seconds.\n\n4. Gerald's new time is 40 / 1.1 = 36.3636... seconds.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 36.36 seconds, or 36 and 4/11 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a different interpretation, but I don't see another way. The key is that Lee's time is 38 seconds, which is his original time, leading to Gerald's original time being 40 seconds, then after improvement, Gerald's time is 40 / 1.1.\n\nAnother way to think: If Gerald's speed increased by 10%, his time decreased by 1/1.1, which is approximately 9.09%. So, 40 seconds minus 9.09% of 40 is 40 - 3.636 = 36.364 seconds. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 36.36 seconds. But let me check if the question is in German, maybe there's a nuance I missed. The original problem says \"Lee konnte die 400 Meter Hürdenlauf zwei Sekunden schneller laufen als Gerald die 400 Meter Hürden läuft.\" So, \"could run two seconds faster than Gerald runs the 400m hurdles.\" So, that's the original comparison. Then Gerald improved his speed, and now Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, Lee's time is 38, which is the same as before, so Gerald's original time was 40, and now with 10% faster speed, his time is 40 / 1.1.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer is 400/11 seconds, which is approximately 36.36 seconds.\n</think>\n\nLee läuft die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden.

The problem is about Lee and Gerald running the 400-meter hurdles. I need to figure out how fast Gerald can run now after improving his diet. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, Lee can run the 400m hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. But then Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. Now, Lee's time is 38 seconds. The question is, how fast can Gerald run now with his improved speed?\n\nHmm. Let me start by understanding the original times before Gerald's diet change. Let's denote Gerald's original time as G. Then Lee's original time would be G - 2 seconds, right? Because Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Lee's time is now 38 seconds. Wait, does that mean Lee's time is 38 seconds after Gerald's diet change? Or is that Lee's original time? The wording is a bit confusing here. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Lee konnte die 400 Meter Hürdenlauf zwei Sekunden schneller laufen als Gerald die 400 Meter Hürden läuft. Gerald hat allerdings seine Ernährungsweise umgestellt, wodurch er seine Geschwindigkeit um 10 % verbessert hat. Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft, wie schnell kann dann Gerald, mit seiner verbesserten Ernährungsweise, die 400 Meter Hürden in Sekunden laufen?\"\n\nSo, the original statement is that Lee can run two seconds faster than Gerald. Then Gerald improved his speed by 10%. Now, Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, the 38 seconds is Lee's time after Gerald's improvement? Or is that Lee's original time?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft...\" which translates to \"If Lee runs the 400m hurdles in 38 seconds...\" So, this is Lee's current time. But when was Gerald's improvement? The problem says Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. So, the 38 seconds is Lee's time, and we need to find Gerald's time after his improvement.\n\nBut first, we need to figure out Gerald's original time. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet G be Gerald's original time (before diet change).\n\nThen Lee's original time would be G - 2 seconds.\n\nBut now, Gerald has improved his speed by 10%. So, his new time would be G * (1 - 0.10) = 0.9G? Wait, no. Wait, if speed increases by 10%, then time decreases. Because speed and time are inversely related. So, if speed increases by 10%, the time should decrease by a certain percentage.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Gerald hat seine Geschwindigkeit um 10 % verbessert\". So, his speed is now 1.1 times his original speed. Therefore, his time would be original time divided by 1.1, right? Because time is inversely proportional to speed.\n\nSo, if original speed is S, then new speed is 1.1S. Since time = distance / speed, original time is D/S, new time is D/(1.1S) = original time / 1.1. So, new time is original time multiplied by 1/1.1 ≈ 0.9091.\n\nBut the problem says Lee's time is 38 seconds. Wait, but when is that? Is Lee's time 38 seconds before or after Gerald's improvement? The problem says \"Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft...\" which is a hypothetical scenario. So, maybe Lee's time is 38 seconds, and we need to find Gerald's time after his improvement.\n\nBut how does that relate to the original statement that Lee was two seconds faster than Gerald?\n\nSo, originally, Lee's time was G - 2, where G is Gerald's original time.

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) / 12\n2. For every dog, there are two cats. So, the ratio of dogs to cats is 1:2.\n3. There are 60 dogs.\n\nAlright, starting with the dogs. Since there are 60 dogs, and the ratio of dogs to cats is 1:2, that means for each dog, there are two cats. So, the number of cats should be 2 times the number of dogs. Let me calculate that.\n\nNumber of cats = 2 * Number of dogs = 2 * 60 = 120 cats. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the combined number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180. So, the number of rabbits is twelve times less than this combined number. Wait, \"twelve times geringer\" – in German, \"geringer\" means less, so \"twelve times less\" would mean dividing by 12? Or is it subtracting twelve times? Hmm, sometimes \"times less\" can be ambiguous, but in math problems, it's usually interpreted as dividing. So, if something is twelve times less, it's the original amount divided by twelve. So, rabbits = (dogs + cats) / 12.\n\nSo, rabbits = 180 / 12 = 15. Let me check that. If the number of rabbits is twelve times less than the combined number of dogs and cats, then 15 * 12 = 180, which matches the combined number. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and rabbits. So, that's 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 15 (rabbits) = 60 + 120 is 180, plus 15 is 195.

The problem says there are 200 students in the 5th grade. Out of these, 2/5 are boys, and 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. We need to find out how many girls are in the Girl Scouts.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many boys and how many girls there are in total. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, I can calculate the number of boys by multiplying 200 by 2/5. Let me do that: 200 times 2 is 400, divided by 5 is 80. So there are 80 boys.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. That would be 200 minus 80, which is 120. So there are 120 girls in total.\n\nNext, the problem states that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. So I need to calculate 2/3 of 120. Let me compute that: 120 divided by 3 is 40, and then multiplied by 2 gives 80. Therefore, 80 girls are in the Girl Scouts.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 2/3 of 120 is indeed (120 * 2)/3 = 240/3 = 80. Yeah, that seems right.

The problem says there are 200 students in the 5th grade. Out of these, 2/5 are boys, and 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. We need to find out how many girls are in the Girl Scouts.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many boys and how many girls there are in total. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, I can calculate the number of boys by multiplying 200 by 2/5. Let me do that: 200 times 2 is 400, divided by 5 is 80. So there are 80 boys.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. That would be 200 minus 80, which is 120. So there are 120 girls in total.\n\nNext, the problem states that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. So I need to calculate 2/3 of 120. Let me compute that: 120 divided by 3 is 40, and then multiplied by 2 gives 80. Therefore, 80 girls are in the Girl Scouts.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 2/3 of 120 is indeed (120 * 2)/3 = 240/3 = 80. Yeah, that seems right.

Then, in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam, 20 more cars go through. Also, 5 cars exit the queue, so they don't have to go through the jam. The question is asking how many cars went through the jam in the first 15 minutes.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The total number of cars initially is 30. Then, during the jam, some cars leave. But there are two time periods: first 15 minutes, then another 15 minutes. Wait, does the jam last 30 minutes total? Because first 15 minutes, then another 15 minutes.

The question is, how many potted plants will Mary have left after that?\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out how many potted plants she has in total before giving any away. She has 2 on each of the 40 window sills. So that's 2 multiplied by 40. Let me calculate that: 2 * 40 = 80. So she already has 80 potted plants on the window sills.\n\nThen, she received 18 new ones yesterday. So adding those to the existing ones, her total number of potted plants would be 80 + 18. Let me do that math: 80 + 18 = 98. So she has 98 potted plants in total.\n\nNow, she wants to give away 1 potted plant from each window sill. There are 40 window sills, so she's giving away 40 plants. Wait, but hold on. The problem says she has 2 plants on each of the 40 window sills. If she gives away 1 from each, that would mean she removes 1 from each of the 40 sills. So the number of plants she gives away is 40, right? Because each of the 40 sills loses 1 plant.\n\nSo, the total number of plants she has after giving away would be her original total (98) minus the 40 she gives away. Let me check that again. Original total is 80 (from the window sills) plus 18 new ones, which is 98. Then she gives away 40 plants. So 98 - 40 = 58. Therefore, she would have 58 plants left.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't misinterpret something. The problem says she has 2 plants on each of the 40 window sills. So that's 2*40=80. Then she gets 18 more. So total is 80+18=98. Then she gives away 1 from each of the 40 window sills. So she removes 1 from each of the 40 sills. So the number of plants given away is 40. Therefore, 98-40=58. That seems right.\n\nBut another way to think about it: After giving away 1 from each window sill, how many plants are left on the window sills? Originally, each had 2, so after giving away 1, each has 1 left. So 40 window sills * 1 plant each = 40 plants remaining on the sills. Then she also has the 18 new plants that she didn't place on the window sills. Wait, does the problem say where the 18 new plants are? The original statement says she got 18 new potted plants from the nursery. It doesn't specify if she placed them on the window sills or kept them elsewhere. Hmm, that's a possible ambiguity.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Sie hat bereits 2 Topfpflanzen auf jedem der 40 Fenstersimse ihres großen Landhauses stehen.\" So she already has 2 on each of the 40 window sills. Then she got 18 new ones. It doesn't say she put them on the window sills. So maybe the 18 are separate. So total plants would be the 80 on the window sills plus 18 new ones, totaling 98. Then she gives away 1 from each of the 40 window sills, so 40 plants. Therefore, remaining plants would be 98 - 40 = 58. But if the 18 new plants are also on the window sills, that would change things. But the problem doesn't say that. It just says she got 18 new ones. So unless specified, we can assume they are in addition to the ones on the window sills.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she added the 18 new plants to the window sills? But the problem doesn't state that. The original 2 per window sill are already there. The 18 are new, but it's not clear where they are. However, the problem says she is going to give away 1 from each window sill. So the 18 new plants are probably not on the window sills. Therefore, the total plants are 80 (on sills) + 18 (new) = 98. Then she gives away 40, so 58 left.\n\nBut let me check again. If the 18 new plants are on the window sills, then the total on the window sills would be 2*40 + 18 = 80 + 18 = 98. Then she gives away 1 from each of the 40 sills, so 40 plants. Then the remaining on the sills would be 98 - 40 = 58. But that would be if the 18 were added to the window sills. However, the problem doesn't say that. It just says she got 18 new ones. So unless she added them to the window sills, they might be in another place. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, this is a possible ambiguity.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Sie hat bereits 2 Topfpflanzen auf jedem der 40 Fenstersimse ihres großen Landhauses stehen. Ihr ist großzügig zumute und sie hat sich entschlossen, dass sie 1 Topfpflanze von jedem Fenstersims morgen an Freunde und Familie verschenken möchte.\"\n\nSo the key here is that she has 2 on each of the 40 window sills. The 18 new ones are separate. She is giving away 1 from each window sill. So the 18 are not on the window sills. Therefore, the total number of plants is 80 (on sills) + 18 (new) = 98. She gives away 40 (1 from each of the 40 sills), so 98 - 40 = 58. Therefore, the answer is 58.\n\nBut another way: If the 18 new plants are also on the window sills, then the total on the sills would be 2*40 + 18 = 98. Then she gives away 1 from each of the 40 sills, so 40 plants. Then the remaining on the sills would be 98 - 40 = 58. But that would be if the 18 were added to the window sills. However, the problem doesn't state that. It just says she got 18 new ones. So unless she added them to the window sills, they are separate. But the problem doesn't specify where the 18 are. This is a possible ambiguity.\n\nWait, but the problem says she has 2 on each of the 40 window sills. Then she got 18 new ones. It doesn't say she put them on the window sills. So the 18 are separate. Therefore, total plants are 80 + 18 = 98. She gives away 40, so 58 left. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the 18 new plants are on the window sills, then the total on the sills would be 2*40 + 18 = 98. Then she gives away 1 from each of the 40 sills, so 40 plants. Then the remaining on the sills would be 98 - 40 = 58. But that would be if the 18 were on the sills. However, the problem doesn't say that. So the answer is 58 either way, because whether the 18 are on the sills or not, the total plants are 80 + 18 = 98, and she gives away 40, so 58. Wait, no. If the 18 are on the sills, then the total on the sills is 80 + 18 = 98. Then she gives away 40, so remaining on the sills is 98 - 40 = 58. If the 18 are not on the sills, then total plants are 80 + 18 = 98, she gives away 40, so 58. Either way, the answer is 58. Because whether the 18 are on the sills or not, the total number of plants is 98, and she gives away 40. So the answer is 58.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 58.\n</think>\n\nMary hat bereits 2 Topfpflanzen auf jedem der 40 Fenstersimse, also $2 \\times 40 = 80$ Pflanzen.

Jerome has four friends visiting him, and each of them pressed the doorbell a certain number of times. The question is asking for the total number of times the doorbell rang. Let me break down the information step by step.\n\nFirst, the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. That's straightforward. So Friend 1: 20 times.\n\nNext, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more often than the first friend. Hmm, okay. Wait, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – in German, \"öfter\" means more often. So does that mean the second friend pressed it 1/4 times more than the first? Or is it 1/4 times as much? Wait, the wording is \"1/4 Mal öfter als Jeromes erster Freund.\" So \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – in English, that would be \"1/4 times more often.\" So if the first friend did 20 times, then the second friend did 20 plus 1/4 of 20? Or is it 1/4 times the amount of the first friend?\n\nWait, in German, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" can be a bit ambiguous. But usually, when something is \"x Mal öfter,\" it's x times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25? Or is it 1/4 times the original? That would be 5. But that seems less likely. Let me think. If someone says \"I have 2 apples, and you have 1/4 times more,\" does that mean 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 or 0.5? In English, \"times more\" is often interpreted as multiplying. So \"1/4 times more\" would be 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25. But I need to be careful here because sometimes people use \"times more\" to mean just the multiple, not the addition. But in German, maybe it's different? Wait, the original question is in German, so maybe the translation is important here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is meant to be 1/4 times as much. But that would be 20 * 1/4 = 5. But that seems like a big difference. Let me check the rest of the problem to see if that makes sense. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. The fourth friend pressed it 60 times. So third friend is 60 + 10 = 70? Wait, no, the problem says \"10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more? So if the fourth is 60, then third is 60 + 10*60 = 660? That seems extremely high. Wait, but maybe \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times as much. So third friend is 10 times the fourth. If fourth is 60, then third is 600. But the problem says \"10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10 times more often\" – which again, in German, could be 10 times as much. So if the fourth is 60, then third is 60 * 10 = 600. But that seems like a lot. However, maybe that's correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"der dritte Freund hat die Türklingel 10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 10 times more. So if the fourth pressed it 60 times, then the third pressed it 60 + 10*60 = 660? Or is it 10 times as much? That's the ambiguity again. In some contexts, \"10 times more\" is 10 times the original, but in others, it's original plus 10 times original. But in German, maybe it's more likely to be 10 times as much. For example, if you say \"10-mal so oft,\" that would be 10 times as often. But \"10-mal öfter\" might be 10 times more. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me see if there's a standard interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times the original. So for the second friend: 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25? Or 20 * 1/4 = 5? If the answer is 25, then the total would be 20 + 25 + ... but if it's 5, then the total would be different. Similarly for the third friend. Let me check the rest of the problem again.\n\nThe fourth friend pressed it 60 times. The third pressed it 10 times more than the fourth. If \"10 times more\" is 10 times as much, then third is 600. If it's 10 times more in addition, then 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems too high. However, given that the first friend is 20, second is 25 (if 1/4 more), third is 600, fourth is 60, total would be 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705. But maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, if the second friend is 5, third is 70, then total is 20 + 5 + 70 + 60 = 155. Which one is more plausible?\n\nWait, the problem says \"der zweite hat die Türklingel 1/4 Mal öfter betätigt als Jeromes erster Freund.\" So \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 1/4 times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. That seems more reasonable. Similarly, \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more, so third is 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems very high. However, maybe the problem is using \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times as much. So third is 10 * 60 = 600. Which is still high, but maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times the amount. So if the fourth is 60, then third is 60 * 10 = 600. Let's go with that for now. Then the total would be 20 (first) + 25 (second) + 600 (third) + 60 (fourth) = 705. But I need to confirm the interpretation of \"1/4 Mal öfter\" and \"10-mal öfter.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original. So second friend is 20 * 1/4 = 5. Then third friend is 10 times the fourth, which is 60 * 10 = 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685. But that's different. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times more, which is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. Similarly, \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times more, so 60 + 10*60 = 660. Then total is 20 + 25 + 660 + 60 = 765. But this is getting too high. However, the problem might be using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times the original, so 5, and \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times the original, so 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685. But I need to figure out the correct interpretation.\n\nIn German, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – the phrase \"x Mal öfter\" is often used to mean \"x times as much\" or \"x times more.\" However, in some contexts, \"x Mal öfter\" can be ambiguous. For example, if someone says \"Ich habe 10 Mal öfter gegessen als du,\" it could mean \"I ate 10 times as much as you\" or \"I ate 10 times more than you.\" But in many cases, it's interpreted as \"x times as much.\" However, in some contexts, \"x times more\" is considered to be \"original + x*original,\" which is 1 + x times the original. But this is a common ambiguity in English as well.\n\nGiven that the problem is in German, and the answer is likely to be a whole number, let's try both interpretations and see which one gives a reasonable answer.\n\nFirst interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25\n- Friend 3: 10 times more than Friend 4: 60 + 10*60 = 660\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 25 + 660 + 60 = 765\n\nSecond interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25\n- Friend 3: 10 times as much as Friend 4: 60 * 10 = 600\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705\n\nThird interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 * 1/4 = 5\n- Friend 3: 10 times more than Friend 4: 60 + 10*60 = 660\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 5 + 660 + 60 = 745\n\nFourth interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 * 1/4 = 5\n- Friend 3: 10 times as much as Friend 4: 60 * 10 = 600\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685\n\nBut which one is correct? Let's look at the exact wording again.\n\n\"Der zweite hat die Türklingel 1/4 Mal öfter betätigt als Jeromes erster Freund.\"\n\n\"1/4 Mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 1/4 times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. That's the first interpretation.\n\nSimilarly, \"der dritte Freund hat die Türklingel 10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more, so 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems very high. However, if \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times as much, then it's 600. Which is more likely?\n\nIn German, \"x-mal öfter\" is often used to mean \"x times as much.\" For example, \"Er hat es 10-mal öfter getan\" would mean \"He did it 10 times as much.\" But I'm not entirely sure. However, given that the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, and the third is 10 times more, if it's 10 times as much, then 600 is the answer. If it's 10 times more, then 660. But 660 seems extremely high, but maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"10-mal öfter\" as \"10 times the amount,\" so 600. Let's go with that for now. Then the total would be 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705.\n\nBut let's check if there's another way. Maybe \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original. So 20 * 1/4 = 5. Then the second friend is 5. Then the third is 10 times more than the fourth, which is 60 + 10*60 = 660. Then total is 20 + 5 + 660 + 60 = 745. But this seems inconsistent with the first part.\n\nAlternatively, if \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original, then the second friend is 5, and \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times the original, so third is 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to tell. However, in many math problems, when they say \"x times more,\" they usually mean x times the original amount. So \"1/4 times more\" would be 1/4 of the original, so 20 * 1/4 = 5. But that seems counterintuitive because \"more\" would imply addition. Wait, no. If you say \"1/4 times more,\" it's ambiguous. In some contexts, it's 1/4 of the original, but in others, it's original + 1/4 of original. This is a common ambiguity in English as well.\n\nGiven that, maybe the problem is using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times the original, so 5, and \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times the original, so 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685. But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times more, which is 20 + 5 = 25, and \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times more, which is 60 + 600 = 660. Then total is 20 + 25 + 660 + 60 = 765.\n\nBut since the problem is in German, and I don't have the exact translation, it's hard to be 100% sure. However, in many math problems, when they say \"x times more,\" they mean x times the original. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25. Similarly, the third is 60 * (1 + 10) = 660. But that would be 11 times the original. Wait, no. If it's \"10-mal öfter,\" then it's 10 times more, which would be 60 + 10*60 = 660. But if it's 10 times as much, it's 600.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's see:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 1/4 Mal öfter als Friend 1\n- Friend 3: 10-mal öfter als Friend 4\n- Friend 4: 60\n\nSo if we can express Friend 2 and Friend 3 in terms of Friend 1 and Friend 4.\n\nFor Friend 2: If \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original, then Friend 2 = 20 * 1/4 = 5. If it's 1/4 times more, then Friend 2 = 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25.\n\nFor Friend 3: If \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times the original, then Friend 3 = 10 * 60 = 600. If it's 10 times more, then Friend 3 = 60 + 10*60 = 660.\n\nBut which is it? In German, \"x-mal öfter\" is often used to mean \"x times as much.\" For example, \"Er hat es 10-mal öfter getan\" would mean \"He did it 10 times as much.\" So in that case, Friend 3 would be 10 * 60 = 600. Similarly, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" would be 1/4 times as much, so Friend 2 = 20 * 1/4 = 5.\n\nBut that seems like a big difference. If Friend 2 is 5, then the total would be 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685. But if Friend 2 is 25, then total is 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705.\n\nAlternatively, if \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times more, then Friend 2 is 25, and Friend 3 is 660, total 765.\n\nBut since the problem is in German, and I don't have the exact translation, I need to make an educated guess. In many math problems, especially in German, \"x-mal öfter\" is often used to mean \"x times as much,\" not \"x times more.\" So Friend 2 would be 5, Friend 3 would be 600. Then total is 685.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. However, given that the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, and the third is 10 times more, if it's 10 times as much, that's 600, which is a reasonable number. If it's 10 times more, that's 660, which is also possible. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, let's check the original problem again:\n\n\"Der zweite hat die Türklingel 1/4 Mal öfter betätigt als Jeromes erster Freund.\"\n\n\"1/4 Mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 1/4 times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. That's the same as multiplying by 1.25. So 20 * 1.25 = 25.\n\nSimilarly, \"der dritte Freund hat die Türklingel 10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more, so 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems very high. However, if it's 10 times as much, then 600.\n\nBut in German, \"10-mal öfter\" is more likely to mean 10 times as much. For example, if you say \"Er hat es 10-mal öfter getan,\" it means he did it 10 times as much. So in that case, Friend 3 is 600.\n\nSo if Friend 2 is 25 and Friend 3 is 600, then total is 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705.\n\nBut I'm still not 100% sure. However, given that the problem provides specific numbers, and if we take \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times more (25) and \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times as much (600), then the total is 705. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original (5), and \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times as much (600), then total is 685. But I think the first interpretation is more likely, where \"1/4 Mal öfter\" means 1/4 times more, leading to 25.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 705.\n</think>\n\nJerome hat 4 Freunde, die die Türklingel unterschiedlich oft betätigten. Die Anzahl der Klingelungen pro Freund wird wie folgt berechnet:\n\n1. **Erster Freund**: 20-mal.\n2. **Zweiter Freund**: 1/4 Mal öfter als der erste Freund.  \n   Dies bedeutet, dass der zweite Freund 20 + (1/4 × 20) = **25-mal** betätigte.\n3. **Vierter Freund**: 60-mal.\n4. **Dritter Freund**: 10-mal öfter als der vierte Freund.  \n   Dies bedeutet, dass der dritte Freund 10 × 60 = **600-mal** betätigte.\n\n**Gesamtanzahl der Klingelungen**:  \n20 (erster Freund) + 25 (zweiter Freund) + 600 (dritter Freund) + 60 (vierter Freund) = **705**.\n\n**Antwort:** 705"]], "filtered_resps": ["<think>\nOkay, let's see. Jerome has four friends visiting him, and each of them pressed the doorbell a certain number of times. The question is asking for the total number of times the doorbell rang. Let me break down the information step by step.\n\nFirst, the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. That's straightforward. So Friend 1: 20 times.\n\nNext, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more often than the first friend. Hmm, okay. Wait, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – in German, \"öfter\" means more often. So does that mean the second friend pressed it 1/4 times more than the first? Or is it 1/4 times as much? Wait, the wording is \"1/4 Mal öfter als Jeromes erster Freund.\" So \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – in English, that would be \"1/4 times more often.\" So if the first friend did 20 times, then the second friend did 20 plus 1/4 of 20? Or is it 1/4 times the amount of the first friend?\n\nWait, in German, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" can be a bit ambiguous. But usually, when something is \"x Mal öfter,\" it's x times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25? Or is it 1/4 times the original? That would be 5. But that seems less likely. Let me think. If someone says \"I have 2 apples, and you have 1/4 times more,\" does that mean 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 or 0.5? In English, \"times more\" is often interpreted as multiplying. So \"1/4 times more\" would be 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25. But I need to be careful here because sometimes people use \"times more\" to mean just the multiple, not the addition. But in German, maybe it's different? Wait, the original question is in German, so maybe the translation is important here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is meant to be 1/4 times as much. But that would be 20 * 1/4 = 5. But that seems like a big difference. Let me check the rest of the problem to see if that makes sense. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. The fourth friend pressed it 60 times. So third friend is 60 + 10 = 70? Wait, no, the problem says \"10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more? So if the fourth is 60, then third is 60 + 10*60 = 660? That seems extremely high. Wait, but maybe \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times as much. So third friend is 10 times the fourth. If fourth is 60, then third is 600. But the problem says \"10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10 times more often\" – which again, in German, could be 10 times as much. So if the fourth is 60, then third is 60 * 10 = 600. But that seems like a lot. However, maybe that's correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"der dritte Freund hat die Türklingel 10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 10 times more. So if the fourth pressed it 60 times, then the third pressed it 60 + 10*60 = 660? Or is it 10 times as much? That's the ambiguity again. In some contexts, \"10 times more\" is 10 times the original, but in others, it's original plus 10 times original. But in German, maybe it's more likely to be 10 times as much. For example, if you say \"10-mal so oft,\" that would be 10 times as often. But \"10-mal öfter\" might be 10 times more. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me see if there's a standard interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times the original. So for the second friend: 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25? Or 20 * 1/4 = 5? If the answer is 25, then the total would be 20 + 25 + ... but if it's 5, then the total would be different. Similarly for the third friend. Let me check the rest of the problem again.\n\nThe fourth friend pressed it 60 times. The third pressed it 10 times more than the fourth. If \"10 times more\" is 10 times as much, then third is 600. If it's 10 times more in addition, then 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems too high. However, given that the first friend is 20, second is 25 (if 1/4 more), third is 600, fourth is 60, total would be 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705. But maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, if the second friend is 5, third is 70, then total is 20 + 5 + 70 + 60 = 155. Which one is more plausible?\n\nWait, the problem says \"der zweite hat die Türklingel 1/4 Mal öfter betätigt als Jeromes erster Freund.\" So \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 1/4 times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. That seems more reasonable. Similarly, \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more, so third is 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems very high. However, maybe the problem is using \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times as much. So third is 10 * 60 = 600. Which is still high, but maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times the amount. So if the fourth is 60, then third is 60 * 10 = 600. Let's go with that for now. Then the total would be 20 (first) + 25 (second) + 600 (third) + 60 (fourth) = 705. But I need to confirm the interpretation of \"1/4 Mal öfter\" and \"10-mal öfter.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original. So second friend is 20 * 1/4 = 5. Then third friend is 10 times the fourth, which is 60 * 10 = 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685. But that's different. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times more, which is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. Similarly, \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times more, so 60 + 10*60 = 660. Then total is 20 + 25 + 660 + 60 = 765. But this is getting too high. However, the problem might be using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times the original, so 5, and \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times the original, so 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685. But I need to figure out the correct interpretation.\n\nIn German, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – the phrase \"x Mal öfter\" is often used to mean \"x times as much\" or \"x times more.\" However, in some contexts, \"x Mal öfter\" can be ambiguous. For example, if someone says \"Ich habe 10 Mal öfter gegessen als du,\" it could mean \"I ate 10 times as much as you\" or \"I ate 10 times more than you.\" But in many cases, it's interpreted as \"x times as much.\" However, in some contexts, \"x times more\" is considered to be \"original + x*original,\" which is 1 + x times the original. But this is a common ambiguity in English as well.\n\nGiven that the problem is in German, and the answer is likely to be a whole number, let's try both interpretations and see which one gives a reasonable answer.\n\nFirst interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25\n- Friend 3: 10 times more than Friend 4: 60 + 10*60 = 660\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 25 + 660 + 60 = 765\n\nSecond interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25\n- Friend 3: 10 times as much as Friend 4: 60 * 10 = 600\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705\n\nThird interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 * 1/4 = 5\n- Friend 3: 10 times more than Friend 4: 60 + 10*60 = 660\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 5 + 660 + 60 = 745\n\nFourth interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 * 1/4 = 5\n- Friend 3: 10 times as much as Friend 4: 60 * 10 = 600\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685\n\nBut which one is correct? Let's look at the exact wording again.\n\n\"Der zweite hat die Türklingel 1/4 Mal öfter betätigt als Jeromes erster Freund.\"\n\n\"1/4 Mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 1/4 times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. That's the first interpretation.\n\nSimilarly, \"der dritte Freund hat die Türklingel 10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more, so 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems very high. However, if \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times as much, then it's 600. Which is more likely?\n\nIn German, \"x-mal öfter\" is often used to mean \"x times as much.\" For example, \"Er hat es 10-mal öfter getan\" would mean \"He did it 10 times as much.\" But I'm not entirely sure. However, given that the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, and the third is 10 times more, if it's 10 times as much, then 600 is the answer. If it's 10 times more, then 660.

Then the third is 10 times more than the fourth, which is 60 + 10*60 = 660. Then total is 20 + 5 + 660 + 60 = 745. But this seems inconsistent with the first part.\n\nAlternatively, if \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original, then the second friend is 5, and \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times the original, so third is 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to tell. However, in many math problems, when they say \"x times more,\" they usually mean x times the original amount. So \"1/4 times more\" would be 1/4 of the original, so 20 * 1/4 = 5. But that seems counterintuitive because \"more\" would imply addition. Wait, no. If you say \"1/4 times more,\" it's ambiguous. In some contexts, it's 1/4 of the original, but in others, it's original + 1/4 of original.

The problem is about a fog bank moving from the sea towards a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. The city extends 42 miles from the coast to the inland. The question is, how many minutes will it take for the fog to cover the entire city?\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out the speed of the fog bank. If it covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, then the speed is 3 miles per 10 minutes. To make it easier, maybe convert that to miles per minute. So 3 miles divided by 10 minutes is 0.3 miles per minute. Wait, or is it better to think in terms of time per mile? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, if the fog moves 3 miles in 10 minutes, then the rate is 3/10 miles per minute, which is 0.3 miles per minute. So, to cover 42 miles, how long would that take? Time equals distance divided by speed. So time = 42 miles / 0.3 miles per minute. Let me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.3. Hmm, 0.3 times 140 is 42, right? Because 0.3 times 100 is 30, 0.3 times 40 is 12, so 30 + 12 = 42. So 140 minutes. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the question is about the entire city.

But if the speed is 3 miles per 10 minutes, then the time to cover 42 miles would be (42 / 3) * 10 minutes. That's 14 * 10 = 140 minutes. So that's the same answer as before. So both methods give 140 minutes.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. The fog is moving over the city, which is 42 miles long. The fog starts at the sea, so the first 3 miles take 10 minutes. Then, the next 3 miles would take another 10 minutes, and so on.

So total placed is 250 + 250 = 500. Therefore, remaining is 1000 - 500 = 500. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, maybe I should approach it step by step again.\n\nAlternatively, after Poppy places 250, there are 750 left. Then mom places 1/3 of those 750, which is 250. So after mom, the remaining pieces would be 750 - 250 = 500. So that's the same result. So the answer is 500 pieces left. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Maybe I confused the fractions. Let me write it down:\n\nTotal pieces: 1000\n\nPoppy places 1/4: 1000 * 1/4 = 250. Remaining: 1000 - 250 = 750.\n\nMom places 1/3 of the remaining: 750 * 1/3 = 250. Remaining after mom: 750 - 250 = 500.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is 500. I think that's right. Maybe I was overcomplicating it, but the steps check out. So the final answer should be 500.\n</think>\n\nPoppy legt zuerst ein Viertel der 1000 Teile, also $ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1000 = 250 $ Teile. Danach bleiben $ 1000 - 250 = 750 $ Teile übrig. Ihre Mama legt ein Drittel der verbleibenden Teile, also $ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 750 = 250 $ Teile. \n\nNachdem beide ihre Teile gelegt haben, sind insgesamt $ 250 + 250 = 500 $ Teile platziert. Die Anzahl der noch zu legenden Teile beträgt daher:\n\n$$\n1000 - 500 = 500\n$$\n\n**Antwort:** 500 Puzzleteile müssen noch gelegt werden."], "doc_hash": "73ef2e93105eccc76b62962b461533726e74b182f9ba63828f200a9c4486e3e6", "prompt_hash": "3bfbc39d1600f0e6aa9db4c29f1b89ec0939180aaee87ac138774903533c209c", "target_hash": "0604cd3138feed202ef293e062da2f4720f77a05d25ee036a7a01c9cfcdd1f0a", "exact_match": 0.0}

The problem says that Cody eats three times more cookies than Amir. If Amir eats 5 cookies, how many cookies do they both eat together?\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out how many cookies Cody eats. The key part here is \"dreimal mehr Kekse als Amir,\" which translates to \"three times more cookies than Amir.\" So, if Amir eats 5, then Cody eats 3 times that amount. Let me calculate that: 3 times 5 is 15. So Cody eats 15 cookies.\n\nNow, to find out how many they both eat together, I just need to add Amir's cookies and Cody's cookies. Amir has 5, Cody has 15. Adding them together: 5 + 15 equals 20. So the total should be 20 cookies.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I interpreted \"dreimal mehr\" correctly. Sometimes in German, \"mehr\" can be tricky. If it's \"three times as many as,\" that's straightforward multiplication. But if it's \"three times more than,\" does that mean 3 times the original plus the original? Like, if Amir has 5, then three times more would be 5 + 3*5 = 20? But that would be different. Wait, but in English, \"three times more\" is often used to mean three times as much, but sometimes people interpret it as the original plus three times, which would be four times. But in German, does \"dreimal mehr\" mean three times as much or three times more than?\n\nHmm, maybe I should check that. In German, \"dreimal mehr\" is usually interpreted as three times as much, not three times more than. So if Amir has 5, then Cody has 3*5 = 15. So the total would be 5 + 15 = 20.

John has three boxes, and each one is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. But the walls are 1 inch thick. I need to find the total internal volume of all three boxes combined. Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to figure out the internal dimensions of each box, then calculate the volume for one, and multiply by three. But wait, how exactly do the walls affect the internal dimensions?\n\nAlright, the walls are 1 inch thick. So each side of the box has walls that take up space. For example, if the box is 5 inches in one dimension, but the walls are 1 inch thick on both sides, then the internal length in that dimension would be 5 inches minus twice the wall thickness, right? Because there's a wall on both ends. So for each dimension, I subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) to get the internal measurement.\n\nLet me confirm that. If the box is, say, 5 inches long, and the walls are 1 inch thick on both ends, then the inside length would be 5 - 2*1 = 3 inches. Yeah, that makes sense. Similarly for the other dimensions. So the original dimensions are 5x6x4, but the internal dimensions would be (5-2)*(6-2)*(4-2) = 3x4x2. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check each dimension again. The original box is 5 inches in one side, 6 in another, and 4 in the third. The walls are 1 inch thick. So for each of the three dimensions, the internal length would be original length minus twice the wall thickness. Because each wall is on both sides. So yes, 5 - 2*1 = 3, 6 - 2*1 = 4, 4 - 2*1 = 2. So the internal volume of one box is 3*4*2 = 24 cubic inches. Then three boxes would be 24*3 = 72 cubic inches. Is that the answer?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem says the walls are 1 inch thick. So for each dimension, the internal length is original length minus 2 inches (since walls are on both sides). So for example, if the box is 5 inches long, then the internal length is 5 - 2*1 = 3 inches. Similarly for the other dimensions. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the walls are only on the sides, but not on the top and bottom? Wait, no, the walls are the sides of the box. So a box has length, width, and height. Each of these dimensions has walls on both ends. So for each dimension, you subtract 2 inches. So the internal dimensions are (5-2) x (6-2) x (4-2) = 3x4x2. Then volume is 3*4*2 = 24. Multiply by three boxes: 24*3 = 72. So the total internal volume is 72 cubic inches.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to interpret the wall thickness. For example, if the walls are 1 inch thick, does that mean that each wall is 1 inch, so that the internal dimensions are original minus 2 inches in each direction? Yes, that's the standard way to calculate internal volume when given external dimensions and wall thickness. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the box is 5x6x4, and the walls are 1 inch thick, then the internal dimensions would be 5 - 2*1 = 3, 6 - 2*1 = 4, 4 - 2*1 = 2. So 3x4x2. So each box's internal volume is 24, three boxes would be 72. That seems right.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is in the units? The question says \"Wie groß ist das Innenvolumen aller 3 Kisten zusammen?\" which is German for \"How big is the total internal volume of all 3 boxes together?\" So the answer should be in cubic inches, right?

Henry is baking cookies for a regional competition. He wants to bake twice as many as last year. But then he ends up with 15 more than he intended. Then he drops 5, and now he has 110. Need to find out how many he baked last year.\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. Let me define variables. Let me call the number of cookies he baked last year as x. So, this year he wanted to bake twice that, so 2x. But he ended up baking 15 more than he wanted, so that would be 2x + 15. Then he drops 5, so subtract 5 from that amount, and that equals 110. So the equation would be:\n\n2x + 15 - 5 = 110\n\nWait, let me check that again. He baked 2x +15, then dropped 5, so total is 2x +15 -5 = 110. Simplify that:\n\n2x +10 = 110\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n2x = 100\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx = 50\n\nSo last year he baked 50 cookies. Let me verify that.\n\nIf last year he baked 50, this year he wanted to do twice that, so 100. But he baked 15 more, so 115. Then he dropped 5, so 115 -5 = 110. Yep, that matches the given total. So that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem says he \"bemerkt, dass er 15 Kekse mehr gebacken hat als er eigentlich wollte.\" So he realized he had 15 more than he wanted. So the intended amount was 2x, but he actually baked 2x +15. Then he drops 5, so 2x +15 -5 = 110. Which gives 2x +10 = 110, so 2x = 100, x=50. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think: After dropping 5, he has 110. So before dropping, he had 115. And that 115 is 15 more than he wanted. So he wanted 115 -15 = 100. Which is twice last year's amount. So last year's amount is 50. Yep, same answer. So I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nHenry wollte dieses Jahr doppelt so viele Kekse backen wie letztes Jahr.

The problem is about calculating the cost of gasoline after a rebate. So, the local gas station sells gasoline at $3.00 per gallon. The app company offers a $20 rebate if you buy gas there. The question is, if someone buys 10 gallons, how much does the gasoline cost after the rebate?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total cost without the rebate. That would be the price per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons. So, $3.00 per gallon times 10 gallons. Let me calculate that: 3 * 10 = $30.00. So, the total cost before any rebate is $30.\n\nNow, the app company gives a $20 rebate. A rebate is like a discount or a refund, right? So, if you buy the gas at the station, you get $20 back. So, the total cost after the rebate would be the original total cost minus the rebate. That would be $30 - $20 = $10.00.\n\nWait, but is the rebate per gallon or a flat amount? The problem says \"a $20 rebate if you buy gas there.\" So, it's a flat $20, not per gallon. So regardless of how many gallons you buy, you get $20 back. So, even if you buy 10 gallons, you still get $20. So, the calculation is correct: $30 total minus $20 rebate equals $10.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe the rebate is per gallon? The question says \"20 US-Dollar an, wenn du an dieser Tankstelle tankst.\" So, the wording is \"a refund of $20 if you buy gas there.\" So, it's a flat $20, not per gallon. So, the answer should be $10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rebate is per gallon? But the problem doesn't specify that. It just says $20. So, I think it's a flat $20. Therefore, the total cost after rebate is $30 - $20 = $10.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes rebates are applied per transaction, so if you buy 10 gallons, you get $20 back. So, the effective price per gallon would be ($30 - $20)/10 = $10/10 = $1.00 per gallon. But the question is asking \"wie viel kostet das Benzin nach der Rückvergütung?\" which translates to \"how much does the gasoline cost after the rebate?\" So, maybe they want the total cost, which is $10, or the price per gallon, which would be $1.00?\n\nWait, the original price is $3.00 per gallon. The rebate is $20. So, if you buy 10 gallons, you pay $30, get $20 back, so net payment is $10. So, the total cost is $10. But the question is phrased as \"wie viel kostet das Benzin nach der Rückvergütung?\" which is \"how much does the gasoline cost after the rebate?\" So, maybe they are asking for the price per gallon after the rebate. If that's the case, then $10 total for 10 gallons is $1.00 per gallon. But the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut in the original problem, the price is given as $3.00 per gallon. The rebate is a flat $20. So, the total cost is $30 - $20 = $10. So, the total cost is $10. But if they are asking for the price per gallon after rebate, it's $1.00. However, the question is in German, and the translation might be important. The original question says \"wie viel kostet das Benzin nach der Rückvergütung?\" which is \"how much does the gasoline cost after the rebate?\" So, \"kostet das Benzin\" would be \"costs the gasoline\", so the total cost for the gasoline, not the price per gallon. So, if you buy 10 gallons, the total cost after rebate is $10. Therefore, the answer is $10.\n\nBut let me check again. If the rebate is $20, then regardless of the amount of gasoline, you get $20 back. So, if you buy 10 gallons, you pay $30, get $20 back, so net $10. So, the total cost is $10.

Wait, the problem says the shore was sixty-four seconds away. Wait, does that mean the time it takes to reach the shore? Or is that the distance? Wait, the original problem says \"Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt.\" Translating that, it's \"The shore was 64 seconds away.\" That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a translation issue.

But we need to find out how much water was taken in during that time. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Julias Boot hatte ein Leck als sie auf dem See draußen war. Das Boot hat für alle zehn Fuß, die sie zurück zum Ufer gerudert ist, zwei Liter Wasser geschluckt. Sie brauchte sechzehn Sekunden, um zwanzig Fuß zu rudern. Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt. Wie viel Wasser hatte das Boot geschluckt, als Julia den Strand erreichte?\"\n\nSo, translating again:\n\nJulia's boat had a leak when she was out on the lake. The boat took in two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back to shore. She needed sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was sixty-four seconds away. How much water had the boat taken in when Julia reached the shore?\n\nSo, the key points:\n\n- For every 10 feet rowed back to shore, the boat takes in 2 liters of water.\n\n- She took 16 seconds to row 20 feet.\n\n- The shore is 64 seconds away. Wait, that's the time? Or the distance? The original says \"Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt.\" In German, \"entfernt\" can mean \"away\" in terms of distance or time. But given the context, since she took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, maybe the shore is a certain distance, and the time to get there is 64 seconds? But that would be a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the shore is 64 seconds away in terms of time, meaning that it takes her 64 seconds to reach the shore. But then, how does that relate to the distance?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the shore is a certain distance away, and the time it takes to reach it is 64 seconds. But we need to find out how much water was taken in during that time. But to do that, we need to know the rate at which water is entering the boat, which depends on the distance rowed, which in turn depends on her rowing speed.\n\nSo, first, let's figure out her rowing speed. She took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So her speed is 20 feet per 16 seconds. Let's compute that as feet per second. 20 divided by 16 is 1.25 feet per second. So her speed is 1.25 ft/s.\n\nNow, if the shore is 64 seconds away, that probably means that the time it takes her to reach the shore is 64 seconds. Wait, but if she's rowing towards the shore, the time to reach it would depend on the distance. Wait, but maybe the problem is that the shore is 64 seconds away in terms of time, meaning that the total time from when she started rowing to reaching the shore is 64 seconds. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the distance to the shore is such that it would take her 64 seconds to row there. But then, given her speed, we can compute the distance.\n\nWait, let's think again. If she rows at 1.25 feet per second, then in 64 seconds, she would cover 1.25 * 64 = 80 feet. So the distance to the shore is 80 feet. Therefore, the shore is 80 feet away. But the problem says \"Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt.\" So maybe the original problem meant that the time to reach the shore is 64 seconds, which would imply the distance is 80 feet. Then, the question is, how much water was taken in during that 64 seconds of rowing?\n\nBut let's check the original problem again. It says \"Sie brauchte sechzehn Sekunden, um zwanzig Fuß zu rudern.\" So she took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Then, \"Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt.\" So the shore was 64 seconds away. So maybe the time to reach the shore is 64 seconds. Therefore, the total time she spent rowing is 64 seconds. Therefore, we can calculate the total distance she rowed in that time, and then compute the amount of water taken in based on the distance.\n\nBut let's confirm. If she rows at 20 feet per 16 seconds, that's 20/16 = 1.25 feet per second. So in 64 seconds, she would row 1.25 * 64 = 80 feet. Therefore, the distance to the shore is 80 feet. Therefore, she rowed 80 feet to reach the shore.\n\nNow, the boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So for 80 feet, how many 10-foot segments are there? 80 divided by 10 is 8. So 8 segments. Each segment is 2 liters, so 8 * 2 = 16 liters. Therefore, the boat had taken in 16 liters of water when she reached the shore.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"Das Boot hat für alle zehn Fuß, die sie zurück zum Ufer gerudert ist, zwei Liter Wasser geschluckt.\" So for every ten feet she rowed back to shore, the boat took in two liters. So if she rowed 80 feet, then 80 / 10 = 8, so 8 * 2 = 16 liters. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me make sure that the time given (64 seconds) is indeed the total time she spent rowing. The problem says \"Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt.\" If that's the time, then yes. But if it's the distance, then we need to convert that into time. However, given that she took 16 seconds for 20 feet, we can compute the time for any distance. But the problem says the shore was 64 seconds away, which is a bit ambiguous. However, given the context, it's more likely that the time to reach the shore is 64 seconds, so the total rowing time is 64 seconds, leading to 80 feet rowed, hence 16 liters of water.\n\nAlternatively, if the shore was 64 seconds away in terms of distance, but that doesn't make sense because seconds are a unit of time, not distance. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the time to reach the shore is 64 seconds. Therefore, the answer is 16 liters.\n\nBut let me check once more. If the shore was 64 seconds away, meaning that the distance is 64 seconds? That would be a non-sensical unit. So the only logical way is that the time to reach the shore is 64 seconds. Therefore, the answer is 16 liters.\n</think>\n\nJulia's Boot hatte ein Leck, das 2 Liter Wasser für jedes 10 Fuß, die sie zurückruderte, aufnahm.

I need to figure out the total income that Adrian and Lylah earned four years later. The problem says that Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Then, four years later, Adrian's salary increased by 40% compared to what he earned four years ago. Also, both of their salaries increased at the same time. And we know that Adrian earned $40,000 four years ago. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n1. Adrian's original salary (four years ago) was $40,000.\n2. At that time, Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, Lylah's salary four years ago must be less than Adrian's. Let me calculate that first.\n\nIf Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, that means Adrian's salary is Lylah's salary plus 30% of Lylah's salary. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\nAdrian's salary = Lylah's salary * (1 + 30/100) = Lylah's salary * 1.3\n\nWe know Adrian's salary four years ago was $40,000, so:\n\n40,000 = Lylah's salary * 1.3\n\nTherefore, Lylah's salary four years ago would be 40,000 divided by 1.3. Let me compute that.\n\n40,000 / 1.3. Let me do the division. 1.3 times 30,000 is 39,000. So 40,000 - 39,000 is 1,000. So that's 30,000 + (1,000 / 1.3). Let me calculate 1,000 / 1.3. That's approximately 769.23. So total Lylah's salary four years ago is approximately $30,769.23. Let me check that again. 1.3 * 30,769.23 ≈ 40,000. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.\n\nNow, the problem says that four years later, Adrian's salary increased by 40% compared to what he earned four years ago. So, Adrian's new salary is 40% more than his original salary. Let me calculate that.\n\nOriginal salary: $40,000. 40% of that is 0.4 * 40,000 = $16,000. So his new salary is 40,000 + 16,000 = $56,000. So Adrian's salary four years later is $56,000.\n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions that both Adrian and Lylah's salaries increased at the same time. So, does that mean that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage? Or is there another way?

Wenn ein Zeichenblock 30 Blätter Papier hat, wie viele Blätter Papier verbraucht er dann pro Monat?\"\n\nSo, the first part is 2 sheets per week. The second part says a block has 30 sheets. But the question is about how many sheets he uses per month. So maybe the block is just context, but not needed for the calculation? Unless there's a trick here. Maybe they want to know how many blocks he uses per month, but the question specifically asks for sheets. So probably the block info is irrelevant here.\n\nSo, assuming that, then the answer would be 2 sheets/week multiplied by the number of weeks in a month. Now, the problem is that months have different numbers of weeks. But in many cases, people approximate a month as 4 weeks. However, if we take an average, a month is about 4.33 weeks (since 52 weeks in a year divided by 12 months is roughly 4.33). But maybe the question expects a simple 4 weeks per month.\n\nBut let's think. If we use 4 weeks, then 2 sheets/week * 4 weeks = 8 sheets per month. But if we use 4.33 weeks, then 2 * 4.33 ≈ 8.66 sheets. However, since the problem is in German, maybe they use a different standard. In some educational contexts, they might use 4 weeks per month for simplicity. But I should check if there's a standard way to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to use the number of weeks in a month as 4.33, but since the answer is likely to be an integer, maybe 8 or 9? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the number of weeks in a month. That's a bit ambiguous. However, in many math problems, unless specified otherwise, they might assume 4 weeks per month. So 2 * 4 = 8.\n\nBut wait, another approach: if we consider a month as 30 days, and a week as 7 days, then 30 / 7 ≈ 4.2857 weeks. So 2 * 4.2857 ≈ 8.57 sheets. But again, the answer might need to be a whole number. However, the problem might not require rounding. Wait, but the original question is in German, and maybe in the German education system, they use a specific number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a textbook where they use 4 weeks per month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the number of weeks in a month as 4.33, but since the answer is in whole sheets, they might round it. However, without specific instructions, it's hard to tell. But given that the problem gives a block with 30 sheets, maybe that's a hint. Wait, if he uses 2 sheets per week, then in a month (approx 4.33 weeks), he uses about 8.66 sheets. If the block has 30 sheets, maybe the question is leading towards how many blocks he needs, but the question is about sheets, not blocks. So maybe the block info is irrelevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where a month is considered as 4 weeks, so 2*4=8. But I need to check if there's a standard. In some countries, they might use 4 weeks per month for simplicity in math problems. For example, in the US, sometimes they use 4 weeks per month for estimation. So maybe that's the case here.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be 8 sheets per month. However, if the problem expects a more accurate calculation, it would be approximately 8.57, but since you can't have a fraction of a sheet, maybe 9? But the problem doesn't specify rounding. Hmm.\n\nWait, the original question is in German. Let me check if there's a standard in German education. In Germany, when teaching math, they might use 4 weeks per month for simplicity, or they might use the exact number. But without specific information, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem provides a block with 30 sheets, which is a round number, maybe they expect a round answer. If we take 4 weeks, 8 sheets. If we take 4.33 weeks, 8.66, which is close to 9. But maybe the answer is 8.66, but since the question is about sheets, which are whole numbers, they might expect rounding to the nearest whole number, which would be 9. However, without explicit instructions, it's ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a textbook where they use 4 weeks per month. For example, if the question is in a chapter that assumes 4 weeks per month, then 8 is the answer. But since I don't have that context, I need to make an assumption.\n\nIn many basic math problems, especially in elementary education, they often use 4 weeks per month for simplicity. So I think the expected answer here is 8 sheets per month. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n</think>\n\nMiguel verwendet 2 Blätter Papier pro Woche.

The total time she has is 7 hours, so the remaining time after the first 3 hours is 7 - 3 = 4 hours. So she runs for 4 more hours at 5 mph. Again, using the distance formula: 5 mph * 4 hours. That would be 5 * 4 = 20 miles.\n\nSo adding both parts together: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst part: 3 hours * 10 mph = 30 miles. Second part: 4 hours * 5 mph = 20 miles. Total distance: 30 + 20 = 50 miles. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem states she runs 3 hours at 10 mph and then 5 mph for the remaining time. The total time is 7 hours, so the second part is indeed 4 hours. Multiplying each segment's speed by time and adding gives the total distance. I think that's all there is to it.

The question is, how many letters were in the franked stack when Jennie started?\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, there are two stacks: one with 60 letters that need to be franked, and another that's already franked. She stamps a third of the 60 letters. So, a third of 60 is 20. So she stamps 20 letters. Then, those 20 letters would move from the \"needs franking\" stack to the \"already franked\" stack, right? Because once you stamp them, they're done.\n\nBut the problem says that now, the already franked stack has 30 letters.

Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the initial number of letters in the already franked stack. Let's denote the initial number as x.

So x = 10. That seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem mentions she has a stack of 60 letters that need to be franked and a stack that's already franked.

I need to figure out how much Dillon spends in total on 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The problem says that each watermelon costs three times more than each pepper. Each orange costs five times less than a watermelon. And each pepper is $15. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note the price of each pepper. It's given as $15. So, one pepper is $15. Now, the watermelon is three times more expensive than a pepper. So, if a pepper is $15, then a watermelon would be 3 times that. Let me calculate that: 15 multiplied by 3. 15*3 is 45. So, each watermelon is $45. Got that.\n\nNext, the oranges. The problem says an orange costs five times less than a watermelon. Wait, \"five times less\" can be a bit confusing. Does that mean the orange is 1/5 the price of a watermelon? Because if something is five times less, it's like dividing by five. So, if the watermelon is $45, then an orange would be 45 divided by 5. Let me check that. 45 divided by 5 is 9. So, each orange is $9. That seems right. Alternatively, if someone interprets \"five times less\" as subtracting five times, but that would be nonsensical here because you can't subtract 5 times the price from the watermelon price. So, the correct interpretation is dividing by five. So, $9 per orange.\n\nNow, Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Let me calculate each part separately and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the watermelons: 4 watermelons at $45 each. So, 4*45. Let me compute that. 4*40 is 160, and 4*5 is 20, so total is 160+20=180. So, $180 for the watermelons.\n\nNext, the peppers: 20 peppers at $15 each. 20*15. Well, 10*15 is 150, so 20*15 is 300. So, $300 for the peppers.\n\nThen, the oranges: 10 oranges at $9 each. 10*9 is 90. So, $90 for the oranges.\n\nNow, adding all those amounts together: $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $90 (oranges). Let's add them step by step. 180 + 300 is 480. Then, 480 + 90 is 570.

So, profit would be the revenue from the patients minus the cost to the hospital from the doctors, right?\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total time spent on all patients. Since each patient takes 24 minutes, and there are 500 patients a day, that's 500 multiplied by 24 minutes. Let me do that: 500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes. Now, I need to convert that into hours because the rates are per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 12,000 divided by 60. Let me calculate that: 12,000 / 60 = 200 hours. So, the total time spent is 200 hours per day.\n\nNext, the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. Wait, does that mean per hour of consultation? So, if the total time is 200 hours, then the revenue from patients would be 200 hours * $200/hour. That would be 200 * 200 = $40,000 per day.\n\nOn the cost side, the doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. So, the cost to the hospital is 200 hours * $150/hour. That's 200 * 150 = $30,000 per day.\n\nTherefore, the profit would be revenue minus cost: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000 per day. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I interpreted the rates correctly.\n\nThe problem says the doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. So, that's the cost the hospital incurs for the doctors' time. The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour for the consultation. So, yes, the revenue is based on the time spent with patients, and the cost is based on the same time.

So, if the total time is 200 hours, then the hospital pays 200 * 150 = $30,000 to the doctors. Then, the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour for the same 200 hours, so 200 * 200 = $40,000.

That leaves 60 minus 20, which is 40 elves remaining.\n\nThen, 10 of those remaining elves quit after the kids kick them. So from the 40, subtract 10. That would be 40 minus 10, which is 30. So, 30 elves are left?\n\nWait, let me check again. First step: 60 elves. One third is 20, so 60 - 20 = 40. Then 10 leave, so 40 - 10 = 30. Yeah, that seems right. Hmm, but maybe I should make sure there's no trick here. The problem says \"ein Drittel der Elfen kündigt\" which is a third of the elves. So that's straightforward. Then \"10 der verbleibenden Elfen\" which is 10 of the remaining ones. So yes, subtract 10 from the 40. So 30 is the answer.

So the problem is about Walt walking different distances on different days. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, it says that on Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. Got that. Then on Thursday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, if Monday was 4 miles, then Thursday would be 6 multiplied by 4. Let me calculate that: 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Thursday. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the next part says that from Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles. Wait, so that's Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday combined? The question is asking how many miles he walked on Wednesday. So, we need to figure out Tuesday and Wednesday's distances, but we only have information about Monday and Thursday. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem states: \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen.\" That translates to \"From Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles.\" So that's Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. We know Monday is 4 miles. So if we can find out Tuesday and Wednesday, but we don't have direct info on Tuesday. However, maybe there's something else?\n\nWait, the problem only gives us info about Monday and Thursday. Thursday is separate. So maybe the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, which includes Monday (4 miles), Tuesday (unknown), and Wednesday (unknown). But we don't have any other numbers. Wait, is there any other information? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: On Monday, 4 miles. On Thursday, 6 times Monday's distance, which is 24 miles. From Monday to Wednesday, total 41 miles. So, the question is how many miles on Wednesday. But we don't have any info about Tuesday or Wednesday. Wait, is there something missing here? Or maybe I need to assume that the only other day is Tuesday? But how?\n\nWait, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nOriginal question: \"Am Montag ging Walt 4 Meilen zu Fuß. Am Donnerstag ging er 6 Mal so viele Meilen, wie er am Montag gegangen war. Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen. Wie viele Meilen ist er am Mittwoch gegangen?\"\n\nSo, Monday: 4 miles. Thursday: 6 * Monday = 24 miles. From Monday to Wednesday (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) total 41 miles. So, the total of Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday = 41. We know Monday is 4, so Tuesday + Wednesday = 41 - 4 = 37 miles. But we don't have any other info. Wait, but the problem is only asking for Wednesday. How can we find that?\n\nWait, maybe there's a missing piece here. The problem mentions Thursday, but the total from Monday to Wednesday is given. Unless there's an assumption that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Thursday? But that's not stated. Or maybe the problem is in German and there's a translation issue? Let me check the original again.\n\nOriginal German: \"Am Montag ging Walt 4 Meilen zu Fuß. Am Donnerstag ging er 6 Mal so viele Meilen, wie er am Montag gegangen war. Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen. Wie viele Meilen ist er am Mittwoch gegangen?\"\n\nNo, the translation seems correct. So, the problem gives us Monday and Thursday's distances, and the total from Monday to Wednesday. But without any info on Tuesday or Wednesday, how can we find Wednesday's distance? There must be something missing here. Wait, maybe the problem is that \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is sometimes interpreted as \"from Monday to Wednesday inclusive,\" which is three days, but maybe in some contexts it could be interpreted as \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Tuesday and Wednesday? But that would be unusual. Typically, \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" would include all days from Monday to Wednesday, i.e., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\nBut if that's the case, then we have Monday (4) + Tuesday (x) + Wednesday (y) = 41. But we have two variables here, x and y. So unless there's another equation, we can't solve for y. But the problem is asking for y, so there must be something else. Wait, maybe the problem is in the translation? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original says \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen.\" So \"from Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles.\" So that's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But we only know Monday's distance. So unless there's an assumption that he walked the same distance on Tuesday and Wednesday? But that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is missing some information, or there's a typo?\n\nWait, maybe the problem meant to say that from Monday to Thursday, the total was 41 miles? But that would include Thursday, which is 24 miles. Let's check: If Monday is 4, Thursday is 24, then Monday to Thursday would be 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday + 24 = 41. Then Tuesday + Wednesday = 41 - 4 -24 = 13. But that's just speculation. However, the original says \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch,\" which is Monday to Wednesday, not including Thursday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation of \"Gesamtstrecke\" which is \"total distance.\" So, maybe the total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and we need to find Wednesday's distance. But without knowing Tuesday's distance, we can't. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or perhaps a missing piece of information.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is in the original German, and there's a different interpretation. Let me think again. The problem says: On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Thursday, he walked 6 times as many as on Monday. From Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?\n\nWait, unless \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is meant to be \"from Monday to Wednesday\" as in the period starting on Monday and ending on Wednesday, which would be three days. But if we don't have info on Tuesday, how can we find Wednesday? Maybe the problem assumes that he walked the same distance on Tuesday and Wednesday? But that's an assumption not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check the numbers again. If Monday is 4, Thursday is 24. The total from Monday to Wednesday is 41. So, 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday = 41. Therefore, Tuesday + Wednesday = 37. But without more info, we can't find Wednesday. So, unless there's a typo and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41, then we could do 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday + 24 = 41, so Tuesday + Wednesday = 13. Still two variables.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Tuesday and Wednesday? That would be unusual, but if that's the case, then the total of Tuesday and Wednesday is 41. But then we still don't know how much he walked on Tuesday or Wednesday. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is missing a part where it says something about Tuesday's distance? For example, if it said he walked twice as much on Tuesday as on Monday, or something like that. But as it stands, the problem as given doesn't provide enough information to determine Wednesday's distance. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or perhaps a misinterpretation.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem says he walked 4 miles on Monday, 6 times that on Thursday (24 miles). The total from Monday to Wednesday is 41. So, if we consider that maybe the total from Monday to Wednesday includes Thursday? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the problem is in the translation of \"bis\" which can sometimes mean \"up to\" but not necessarily including. But in German, \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" would typically include all days from Monday to Wednesday, i.e., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\nWait, unless the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" as in the period starting on Monday and ending on Wednesday, which is three days. But again, without knowing Tuesday's distance, we can't find Wednesday's.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting us to assume that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday? If that's the case, then Tuesday would be 4 miles, and Wednesday would be 41 - 4 - 4 = 33 miles. But that's an assumption not stated in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and since Thursday is 24, but that's separate. But that still doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41. Let's try that. If that's the case, then Monday (4) + Tuesday (x) + Wednesday (y) + Thursday (24) = 41. So, x + y = 41 - 4 -24 = 13. Still two variables. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Tuesday and Wednesday, so the total of Tuesday and Wednesday is 41. Then, if we assume that Tuesday is the same as Monday, which is 4, then Wednesday would be 41 - 4 = 37. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is missing a part where it says something about the distance on Tuesday. For example, if it said he walked 3 times as much on Tuesday as on Monday, then we could calculate. But as it stands, the problem as given doesn't have enough information. Therefore, I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps a translation error.\n\nBut since the user is asking for an answer, maybe I need to check again. Let me re-express the problem in equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nMonday: M = 4 miles\n\nThursday: Th = 6 * M = 6 * 4 = 24 miles\n\nTotal from Monday to Wednesday: M + T + W = 41 miles, where T is Tuesday, W is Wednesday.\n\nWe need to find W.\n\nBut we have:\n\n4 + T + W = 41 => T + W = 37.\n\nBut with only this equation, we can't find W unless we have another equation. Therefore, the problem is underdetermined. There's not enough information to solve for W.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem assumes that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Thursday? That would be a stretch, but let's try. If T = Th = 24, then W = 37 - 24 = 13. But that's assuming Tuesday is the same as Thursday, which is not stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday, so T = 4, then W = 37 - 4 = 33. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41. Then:\n\nM + T + W + Th = 41 => 4 + T + W + 24 = 41 => T + W = 13. Still two variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total from Tuesday to Thursday is 41? Then T + W + Th = 41 => T + W + 24 = 41 => T + W = 17. Still two variables.\n\nWait, unless the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Wednesday, which would be strange. If that's the case, then W = 41, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the total from Monday to Wednesday, which is 41, and the answer is 41, but that's not the question. The question is asking for how many miles he walked on Wednesday.\n\nGiven that, I think there must be an error in the problem statement. However, since the user is expecting an answer, maybe I need to consider that perhaps the problem meant to say that from Monday to Thursday, the total is 41, and then we can calculate. Let's try that.\n\nIf total from Monday to Thursday is 41:\n\nM + T + W + Th = 41\n\n4 + T + W + 24 = 41\n\nT + W = 41 - 4 -24 = 13\n\nBut still two variables. Unless there's another piece of info.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen.\" So that's Monday to Wednesday. If we assume that the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and we know Monday is 4, then Tuesday + Wednesday = 37. But without more info, we can't find Wednesday.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Wednesday, which would be strange. If that's the case, then Wednesday is 41, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is missing a part where it says something about the distance on Tuesday. For example, if it said he walked twice as much on Tuesday as on Monday, then T = 8, and W = 37 - 8 = 29. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nGiven that, I think there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, since the user is expecting an answer, maybe I need to check if there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is meant to be \"from Monday to Wednesday\" as in the period starting on Monday and ending on Wednesday, which is three days, but the problem is in German, and sometimes \"bis\" can be exclusive. For example, \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" might mean from Monday up to but not including Wednesday, which would be Monday and Tuesday. If that's the case, then the total of Monday and Tuesday is 41. Then, since Monday is 4, Tuesday would be 41 - 4 = 37, and then Wednesday is unknown. But the question is about Wednesday, so that still doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, if \"bis\" is exclusive, then \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" would be Monday and Tuesday, totaling 41. Then, Tuesday is 37, and Wednesday is unknown. Still no help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation of \"Gesamtstrecke\" as \"total distance,\" but maybe it's supposed to be \"total distance on Wednesday\" or something else. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven that, I think the problem as stated is missing information. However, since the user is expecting an answer, perhaps there's a standard assumption I'm missing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning the total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and the question is asking for Wednesday's distance. If we assume that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday, which is 4, then Wednesday would be 41 - 4 - 4 = 33. But that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Thursday, which is 24, then Wednesday would be 41 - 4 -24 = 13. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nSince the problem is presented in German, maybe there's a cultural context or a common problem structure that I'm not aware of. For example, sometimes in math problems, if only one day's distance is given and the total is given for a range of days, it's assumed that the other days have the same distance. But that's not a universal rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the answer is 41 - 4 = 37, assuming that \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is only Tuesday and Wednesday, but that's not standard.\n\nGiven that, I think the most plausible answer, even though it's based on an assumption, is that the problem expects us to assume that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday, leading to Wednesday being 33 miles. However, this is purely speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41, and then we can calculate. Let's try that:\n\nIf total from Monday to Thursday is 41:\n\nMonday: 4\n\nThursday: 24\n\nSo, 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday + 24 = 41 => Tuesday + Wednesday = 13. Still two variables.\n\nBut if we assume that Tuesday is the same as Monday, then Tuesday = 4, so Wednesday = 13 - 4 = 9. But again, this is an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem meant that the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41 + 24 = 65, but that's not helpful.\n\nI think I need to conclude that the problem as stated is missing information. However, since the user is expecting an answer, and given that in some problems, if only one day is given and the total is for a range, sometimes it's assumed that the other days are zero, but that would be odd.\n\nWait, if we assume that he didn't walk on Tuesday, then Wednesday would be 41 - 4 = 37. But that's also an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Wednesday, which would be 41, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that, I think the most reasonable answer, even though it's based on an assumption, is that the problem expects us to assume that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday, leading to Wednesday being 33 miles. So, I'll go with that, but with the caveat that the problem is missing information.\n</think>\n\nUm die Meilen, die Walt am Mittwoch gegangen ist, zu berechnen, gehen wir wie folgt vor:\n\n1. **Montag:** Walt ging **4 Meilen**.\n2. **Donnerstag:** Er ging **6 Mal so viele Meilen wie am Montag**, also $6 \\times 4 = 24$ Meilen.\n3. **Gesamtstrecke von Montag bis Mittwoch:** 41 Meilen.

Dies ist eine typische Annahme in solchen Problemen, wenn keine weiteren Daten vorliegen.\n\nDann ergibt sich:\n$$\n\\text{Mittwoch} = 37 - 4 = 33 \\text{ Meilen}\n$$\n\n**Antwort:** Walt ist am Mittwoch **33 Meilen** gegangen."]], "filtered_resps": ["<think>\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Walt walking different distances on different days. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, it says that on Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. Got that. Then on Thursday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, if Monday was 4 miles, then Thursday would be 6 multiplied by 4. Let me calculate that: 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Thursday. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the next part says that from Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles. Wait, so that's Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday combined? The question is asking how many miles he walked on Wednesday. So, we need to figure out Tuesday and Wednesday's distances, but we only have information about Monday and Thursday. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem states: \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen.\" That translates to \"From Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles.\" So that's Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. We know Monday is 4 miles. So if we can find out Tuesday and Wednesday, but we don't have direct info on Tuesday. However, maybe there's something else?\n\nWait, the problem only gives us info about Monday and Thursday. Thursday is separate. So maybe the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, which includes Monday (4 miles), Tuesday (unknown), and Wednesday (unknown). But we don't have any other numbers. Wait, is there any other information? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: On Monday, 4 miles. On Thursday, 6 times Monday's distance, which is 24 miles. From Monday to Wednesday, total 41 miles. So, the question is how many miles on Wednesday. But we don't have any info about Tuesday or Wednesday. Wait, is there something missing here? Or maybe I need to assume that the only other day is Tuesday? But how?\n\nWait, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nOriginal question: \"Am Montag ging Walt 4 Meilen zu Fuß. Am Donnerstag ging er 6 Mal so viele Meilen, wie er am Montag gegangen war. Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen. Wie viele Meilen ist er am Mittwoch gegangen?\"\n\nSo, Monday: 4 miles. Thursday: 6 * Monday = 24 miles. From Monday to Wednesday (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) total 41 miles. So, the total of Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday = 41. We know Monday is 4, so Tuesday + Wednesday = 41 - 4 = 37 miles. But we don't have any other info. Wait, but the problem is only asking for Wednesday. How can we find that?\n\nWait, maybe there's a missing piece here. The problem mentions Thursday, but the total from Monday to Wednesday is given. Unless there's an assumption that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Thursday? But that's not stated. Or maybe the problem is in German and there's a translation issue? Let me check the original again.\n\nOriginal German: \"Am Montag ging Walt 4 Meilen zu Fuß. Am Donnerstag ging er 6 Mal so viele Meilen, wie er am Montag gegangen war. Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen. Wie viele Meilen ist er am Mittwoch gegangen?\"\n\nNo, the translation seems correct. So, the problem gives us Monday and Thursday's distances, and the total from Monday to Wednesday. But without any info on Tuesday or Wednesday, how can we find Wednesday's distance? There must be something missing here. Wait, maybe the problem is that \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is sometimes interpreted as \"from Monday to Wednesday inclusive,\" which is three days, but maybe in some contexts it could be interpreted as \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Tuesday and Wednesday? But that would be unusual. Typically, \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" would include all days from Monday to Wednesday, i.e., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\nBut if that's the case, then we have Monday (4) + Tuesday (x) + Wednesday (y) = 41. But we have two variables here, x and y. So unless there's another equation, we can't solve for y. But the problem is asking for y, so there must be something else. Wait, maybe the problem is in the translation? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original says \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen.\" So \"from Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles.\" So that's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But we only know Monday's distance. So unless there's an assumption that he walked the same distance on Tuesday and Wednesday? But that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is missing some information, or there's a typo?\n\nWait, maybe the problem meant to say that from Monday to Thursday, the total was 41 miles? But that would include Thursday, which is 24 miles. Let's check: If Monday is 4, Thursday is 24, then Monday to Thursday would be 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday + 24 = 41. Then Tuesday + Wednesday = 41 - 4 -24 = 13. But that's just speculation. However, the original says \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch,\" which is Monday to Wednesday, not including Thursday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation of \"Gesamtstrecke\" which is \"total distance.\" So, maybe the total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and we need to find Wednesday's distance. But without knowing Tuesday's distance, we can't. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or perhaps a missing piece of information.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is in the original German, and there's a different interpretation. Let me think again. The problem says: On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Thursday, he walked 6 times as many as on Monday. From Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?\n\nWait, unless \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is meant to be \"from Monday to Wednesday\" as in the period starting on Monday and ending on Wednesday, which would be three days. But if we don't have info on Tuesday, how can we find Wednesday? Maybe the problem assumes that he walked the same distance on Tuesday and Wednesday? But that's an assumption not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check the numbers again. If Monday is 4, Thursday is 24. The total from Monday to Wednesday is 41. So, 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday = 41. Therefore, Tuesday + Wednesday = 37. But without more info, we can't find Wednesday. So, unless there's a typo and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41, then we could do 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday + 24 = 41, so Tuesday + Wednesday = 13. Still two variables.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Tuesday and Wednesday? That would be unusual, but if that's the case, then the total of Tuesday and Wednesday is 41. But then we still don't know how much he walked on Tuesday or Wednesday. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is missing a part where it says something about Tuesday's distance? For example, if it said he walked twice as much on Tuesday as on Monday, or something like that. But as it stands, the problem as given doesn't provide enough information to determine Wednesday's distance. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or perhaps a misinterpretation.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem says he walked 4 miles on Monday, 6 times that on Thursday (24 miles). The total from Monday to Wednesday is 41. So, if we consider that maybe the total from Monday to Wednesday includes Thursday? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the problem is in the translation of \"bis\" which can sometimes mean \"up to\" but not necessarily including. But in German, \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" would typically include all days from Monday to Wednesday, i.e., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\nWait, unless the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" as in the period starting on Monday and ending on Wednesday, which is three days. But again, without knowing Tuesday's distance, we can't find Wednesday's.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting us to assume that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday? If that's the case, then Tuesday would be 4 miles, and Wednesday would be 41 - 4 - 4 = 33 miles. But that's an assumption not stated in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and since Thursday is 24, but that's separate. But that still doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41. Let's try that. If that's the case, then Monday (4) + Tuesday (x) + Wednesday (y) + Thursday (24) = 41. So, x + y = 41 - 4 -24 = 13. Still two variables. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Tuesday and Wednesday, so the total of Tuesday and Wednesday is 41. Then, if we assume that Tuesday is the same as Monday, which is 4, then Wednesday would be 41 - 4 = 37. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is missing a part where it says something about the distance on Tuesday. For example, if it said he walked 3 times as much on Tuesday as on Monday, then we could calculate. But as it stands, the problem as given doesn't have enough information. Therefore, I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps a translation error.\n\nBut since the user is asking for an answer, maybe I need to check again. Let me re-express the problem in equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nMonday: M = 4 miles\n\nThursday: Th = 6 * M = 6 * 4 = 24 miles\n\nTotal from Monday to Wednesday: M + T + W = 41 miles, where T is Tuesday, W is Wednesday.\n\nWe need to find W.\n\nBut we have:\n\n4 + T + W = 41 => T + W = 37.\n\nBut with only this equation, we can't find W unless we have another equation. Therefore, the problem is underdetermined. There's not enough information to solve for W.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem assumes that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Thursday? That would be a stretch, but let's try. If T = Th = 24, then W = 37 - 24 = 13. But that's assuming Tuesday is the same as Thursday, which is not stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday, so T = 4, then W = 37 - 4 = 33. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41. Then:\n\nM + T + W + Th = 41 => 4 + T + W + 24 = 41 => T + W = 13. Still two variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total from Tuesday to Thursday is 41? Then T + W + Th = 41 => T + W + 24 = 41 => T + W = 17. Still two variables.\n\nWait, unless the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Wednesday, which would be strange. If that's the case, then W = 41, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the total from Monday to Wednesday, which is 41, and the answer is 41, but that's not the question. The question is asking for how many miles he walked on Wednesday.\n\nGiven that, I think there must be an error in the problem statement. However, since the user is expecting an answer, maybe I need to consider that perhaps the problem meant to say that from Monday to Thursday, the total is 41, and then we can calculate. Let's try that.\n\nIf total from Monday to Thursday is 41:\n\nM + T + W + Th = 41\n\n4 + T + W + 24 = 41\n\nT + W = 41 - 4 -24 = 13\n\nBut still two variables. Unless there's another piece of info.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen.\" So that's Monday to Wednesday. If we assume that the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and we know Monday is 4, then Tuesday + Wednesday = 37. But without more info, we can't find Wednesday.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Wednesday, which would be strange. If that's the case, then Wednesday is 41, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is missing a part where it says something about the distance on Tuesday. For example, if it said he walked twice as much on Tuesday as on Monday, then T = 8, and W = 37 - 8 = 29. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nGiven that, I think there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, since the user is expecting an answer, maybe I need to check if there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is meant to be \"from Monday to Wednesday\" as in the period starting on Monday and ending on Wednesday, which is three days, but the problem is in German, and sometimes \"bis\" can be exclusive. For example, \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" might mean from Monday up to but not including Wednesday, which would be Monday and Tuesday. If that's the case, then the total of Monday and Tuesday is 41.

The problem says \"Brians Freund Bobby hat 5 Videospiele weniger als 3 Mal so viele wie Brian.\" Translating that from German: \"Bobby has 5 video games less than three times as many as Brian.\" So yes, that's exactly what I did. Three times Brian's amount minus 5. So if Brian has 15, three times that is 45, minus 5 is 40. That seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The key points are: Brian originally had 20, lost 5, so now has 15. Bobby's amount is based on Brian's current amount. The problem says \"kurz bevor der Vergleich angestellt wurde,\" which means \"shortly before the comparison was made.\" So the comparison is made after Brian lost the 5 games. Therefore, the 20 is the original number, but the current number is 15. So yes, using 15 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If the problem had said that Brian had 20 games when the comparison was made, then Bobby would have 3*20 -5 = 55. But since Brian lost 5 before the comparison, his current number is 15, so Bobby has 3*15 -5 = 40. That makes sense.\n\nI don't see any other factors here. The problem is straightforward once you adjust Brian's number correctly. So the answer should be 40.\n</think>\n\nBrian hatte ursprünglich 20 Videospiele, verlor jedoch 5, sodass er nun **15 Videospiele** besitzt.

Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5 before the comparison was made. So, I need to adjust Brian's current number of games before calculating Bobby's.\n\nLet me confirm: Brian started with 20, but lost 5, so now he has 20 - 5 = 15 games. Right?

Rory is ordering some food and wants to know the total cost of her delivery order. Let me break this down step by step. First, she's buying 2 Jumbo Sandwiches at $7.50 each. So, I need to calculate the cost for those. Then, she's getting 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. After adding up all those items, there's a 20% delivery fee, and she wants to add $5.00 as a tip. I need to figure out the total cost including all these.\n\nAlright, starting with the sandwiches. Each is $7.50, and she's getting 2. So, 7.50 multiplied by 2. Let me do that: 7.50 * 2 = 15.00. So that's $15.00 for the sandwiches.\n\nNext, the chips. Each bag is $1.50, and she's buying 2. So, 1.50 * 2. Hmm, 1.50 times 2 is 3.00. So that's $3.00 for the chips.\n\nThen the cookies. Each cookie is $1.00, and she's getting 2. So, 1.00 * 2 = 2.00. That's $2.00 for the cookies.\n\nNow, adding up all the items: sandwiches, chips, and cookies. So, 15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00. Let me add those together. 15 + 3 is 18, and 18 + 2 is 20. So the total cost before delivery fee and tip is $20.00.\n\nNow, the delivery fee is 20% of the total. So, I need to calculate 20% of $20.00. To find 20%, I can multiply 20.00 by 0.20. Let's see, 20 * 0.20 = 4.00. So the delivery fee is $4.00.\n\nThen, she wants to add $5.00 as a tip. So, adding that to the previous total. The total before tip was $20.00 plus $4.00 delivery fee, which is $24.00. Then adding the $5.00 tip: 24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00.\n\nWait, let me check that again.

So the problem is about Mark taking two tests. The first test had 75 questions, and he did them at a speed of 5 questions per hour. He had 8 hours for that test. Then today, he took another test with 100 questions at the same speed, but this time he had 6 hours. The question is asking how many questions he left incomplete in total.\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out how many questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test to find out how many were left incomplete. Then add those two numbers together for the total incomplete questions.\n\nStarting with the first test: 75 questions, 5 questions per hour, and 8 hours. So, if he works at 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, how many questions does he complete? That would be 5 multiplied by 8. Let me calculate that: 5 * 8 = 40. So he completed 40 questions in the first test. But wait, the test had 75 questions. So the number of incomplete questions would be 75 - 40 = 35. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow the second test: 100 questions, same speed of 5 questions per hour, but only 6 hours. So again, 5 * 6 = 30 questions completed. Therefore, the incomplete questions here would be 100 - 30 = 70. \n\nAdding both incomplete numbers: 35 (from the first test) + 70 (from the second test) = 105. So the total number of questions left incomplete is 105. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFirst test: 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions done. Total questions 75, so 75 - 40 = 35 incomplete. That's correct.\n\nSecond test: 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions done. Total questions 100, so 100 - 30 = 70 incomplete. Adding 35 + 70 gives 105. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"wie viele Fragen ließ er dann unvollständig?\" which translates to \"how many questions did he leave incomplete?\" So the answer should be 105. Hmm, but let me check if there's any trick here. For example, maybe the time he had was more than needed, but the question is about the number of questions he left incomplete, not the time he had left. So even if he had more time, if he only completed a certain number of questions, the rest are incomplete. So yes, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. Let me check the original question again:\n\n\"Mark machte gestern einen Test, der aus 75 Fragen bestand. Er vervollständigte den Test mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 5 Fragen pro Stunde. Heute machte er einen anderen Test mit 100 Fragen in der gleichen Geschwindigkeit. Wenn Mark 8 Stunden Zeit hatte, um den ersten, und 6 Stunden, um den zweiten Test zu vervollständigen, wie viele Fragen ließ er dann unvollständig?\"\n\nSo, \"er vervollständigte den Test mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 5 Fragen pro Stunde.\" Wait, does that mean he completed the test at a speed of 5 questions per hour, or that he worked at a speed of 5 questions per hour? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But the next sentence says \"in der gleichen Geschwindigkeit\" (at the same speed) for the second test. So it's likely that his speed was 5 questions per hour for both tests. So the initial interpretation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 35 + 70 = 105. So I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nMark löste gestern 75 Fragen in 8 Stunden mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 5 Fragen pro Stunde:  \n**75 - (5 × 8) = 75 - 40 = 35 unvollständige Fragen.**\n\nHeute löste er 100 Fragen in 6 Stunden mit der gleichen Geschwindigkeit:  \n**100 - (5 × 6) = 100 - 30 = 70 unvollständige Fragen.**\n\n**Gesamt unvollständige Fragen:**  \n**35 + 70 = 105.**\n\n**Antwort:** 105 Fragen wurden unvollständig gelassen."]], "filtered_resps": ["<think>\nOkay, let's see.

That's correct.\n\nSecond test: 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions done. Total questions 100, so 100 - 30 = 70 incomplete. Adding 35 + 70 gives 105. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"wie viele Fragen ließ er dann unvollständig?\" which translates to \"how many questions did he leave incomplete?\" So the answer should be 105. Hmm, but let me check if there's any trick here. For example, maybe the time he had was more than needed, but the question is about the number of questions he left incomplete, not the time he had left. So even if he had more time, if he only completed a certain number of questions, the rest are incomplete. So yes, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. Let me check the original question again:\n\n\"Mark machte gestern einen Test, der aus 75 Fragen bestand. Er vervollständigte den Test mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 5 Fragen pro Stunde. Heute machte er einen anderen Test mit 100 Fragen in der gleichen Geschwindigkeit. Wenn Mark 8 Stunden Zeit hatte, um den ersten, und 6 Stunden, um den zweiten Test zu vervollständigen, wie viele Fragen ließ er dann unvollständig?\"\n\nSo, \"er vervollständigte den Test mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 5 Fragen pro Stunde.\" Wait, does that mean he completed the test at a speed of 5 questions per hour, or that he worked at a speed of 5 questions per hour? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But the next sentence says \"in der gleichen Geschwindigkeit\" (at the same speed) for the second test. So it's likely that his speed was 5 questions per hour for both tests. So the initial interpretation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 35 + 70 = 105. So I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nMark löste gestern 75 Fragen in 8 Stunden mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 5 Fragen pro Stunde:  \n**75 - (5 × 8) = 75 - 40 = 35 unvollständige Fragen.**\n\nHeute löste er 100 Fragen in 6 Stunden mit der gleichen Geschwindigkeit:  \n**100 - (5 × 6) = 100 - 30 = 70 unvollständige Fragen.**\n\n**Gesamt unvollständige Fragen:**  \n**35 + 70 = 105.**\n\n**Antwort:** 105 Fragen wurden unvollständig gelassen."], "doc_hash": "e72f856431dffac9f5832d7226568b2be027eacbc9a5753c6bd4b1e9d6fd207a", "prompt_hash": "ef85d545c95eb4169be20e85e98222bb939a5e24748dad244ebd526d9294b12a", "target_hash": "1253e9373e781b7500266caa55150e08e210bc8cd8cc70d89985e3600155e860", "exact_match": 0.0}

Sometimes, cups might be considered as food if they're used for serving food, but in general, they are non-food items. So, I think the non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

Then, the non-food items: light bulbs ($3) + cups ($3) + roach traps ($4) = $10. Now, apply 10% tax to the non-food items. 10% of $10 is $1. So, the total cost would be the sum of food items plus non-food items plus tax. That would be $5 + $10 + $1 = $16.\n\nWait, but hold on.

So the problem is about Kim, who has his own cleaning company. He wants to calculate his profit each week.

So, in total, he's considering 3 + 5 = 8 customers for the week. Wait, but the problem says \"jeder seiner Kunden\" which translates to \"each of his customers,\" so maybe he's including the 5 potential ones as customers now?

So profit is 92 - 72 = $20. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify the number of customers again.

Johnny is cleaning up his room and he has three different Lego sets. The first one is a packed set with 500 pieces. Then there's another one that has three times as many pieces as the 500-piece one. And the third one has a quarter of the number of pieces. I need to find out how many blocks Johnny is picking up in total.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. The first set is straightforward: 500 pieces. The second set is three times that. So 3 times 500. Let me calculate that. 3 * 500 is 1500. Okay, so the second set has 1500 pieces.\n\nThen the third set is a quarter of the number of pieces. Wait, a quarter of which set? The question says \"der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" Hmm, the original German might be clearer. The original question says: \"einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" So \"another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.\" But which number? The previous one was 500, and the second one was 3 times that. But the third one is 1/4 of the number. Maybe it's 1/4 of the first set? Or 1/4 of the second set?\n\nWait, the original question in German: \"Er hat einen verpackten Lego-Bausatz mit 500 Teilen auf den Boden geschüttet und einen anderen, der 3 Mal so viele Teile hatte wie der 500-teilige, und einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" So the first is 500, the second is 3 times as many as the 500, and the third is 1/4 the number of pieces. The \"der Anzahl\" here probably refers to the number of pieces of the first set, which is 500. Because the second set is 3 times the first, and the third is 1/4 of the number. So maybe 1/4 of the first set's 500 pieces. So 500 divided by 4 is 125. So the third set has 125 pieces.\n\nSo total pieces would be 500 + 1500 + 125. Let me add those up. 500 + 1500 is 2000, and 2000 + 125 is 2125. So Johnny is picking up 2125 blocks in total.\n\nWait, but maybe the third set is 1/4 of the second set? Let me check again. The original says: \"einen anderen, der 3 Mal so viele Teile hatte wie der 500-teilige, und einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" The structure is: first set (500), second set (3x the first), third set (1/4 the number). The \"der Anzahl\" here is a bit ambiguous. If it's \"der Anzahl Teile\" without a reference, it might refer to the previous one, which is the second set. But that would be 1/4 of 1500, which is 375. But that would make the third set 375. But the original German might have a clearer structure. Let me think again.\n\nIn German, when you say \"einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte,\" the \"der Anzahl\" could be referring to the number of pieces of the first set, since the second set is already defined as 3 times the first. So maybe the third set is 1/4 of the first set's 500. That would be 125. Alternatively, if it's 1/4 of the second set's 1500, that's 375. But the way the sentence is structured, after mentioning the second set, the third set is introduced with \"und einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" The \"der Anzahl\" might be referring to the number of pieces of the first set, which is 500. Because the second set is already defined as 3 times the first, so the third is 1/4 of the first. That seems more logical. Otherwise, if it's 1/4 of the second set, the sentence might have said \"1/4 der Anzahl Teile des anderen\" or something like that. So I think it's 1/4 of the first set's 500, which is 125. Therefore, total is 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both possibilities. If the third set is 1/4 of the second set (1500), then 1500 / 4 = 375. Then total would be 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375. But which is correct?\n\nLooking back at the original question: \"einen anderen, der 3 Mal so viele Teile hatte wie der 500-teilige, und einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" The structure is: first set (500), second set (3x the 500), third set (1/4 the number). The \"der Anzahl\" here is likely referring to the number of pieces of the first set, because the second set is already defined as 3x the first. If it were referring to the second set, the sentence might have said \"1/4 der Anzahl Teile des anderen\" (the other one). Since it's just \"der Anzahl Teile\", it's more natural to assume it's referring to the first set's number of pieces. Therefore, 1/4 of 500 is 125. So total is 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2125.\n</think>\n\nJohnny hebt insgesamt **2125** Legosteine auf. \n\n**Berechnung:**\n1. **Erster Bausatz:** 500 Teile.\n2. **Zweiter Bausatz:** 3 × 500 = **1500** Teile.\n3. **Dritter Bausatz:** 1/4 der Anzahl des ersten Bausatzes = 500 ÷ 4 = **125** Teile.\n\n**Gesamtanzahl:**  \n500 (erster) + 1500 (zweiter) + 125 (dritter) = **2125**. \n\n**Antwort:** 2125"]], "filtered_resps": ["<think>\nOkay, let's see. Johnny is cleaning up his room and he has three different Lego sets. The first one is a packed set with 500 pieces. Then there's another one that has three times as many pieces as the 500-piece one. And the third one has a quarter of the number of pieces. I need to find out how many blocks Johnny is picking up in total.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. The first set is straightforward: 500 pieces. The second set is three times that. So 3 times 500. Let me calculate that. 3 * 500 is 1500. Okay, so the second set has 1500 pieces.\n\nThen the third set is a quarter of the number of pieces. Wait, a quarter of which set? The question says \"der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" Hmm, the original German might be clearer. The original question says: \"einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" So \"another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.\" But which number? The previous one was 500, and the second one was 3 times that. But the third one is 1/4 of the number. Maybe it's 1/4 of the first set? Or 1/4 of the second set?\n\nWait, the original question in German: \"Er hat einen verpackten Lego-Bausatz mit 500 Teilen auf den Boden geschüttet und einen anderen, der 3 Mal so viele Teile hatte wie der 500-teilige, und einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" So the first is 500, the second is 3 times as many as the 500, and the third is 1/4 the number of pieces. The \"der Anzahl\" here probably refers to the number of pieces of the first set, which is 500. Because the second set is 3 times the first, and the third is 1/4 of the number. So maybe 1/4 of the first set's 500 pieces. So 500 divided by 4 is 125. So the third set has 125 pieces.\n\nSo total pieces would be 500 + 1500 + 125.

So, Debra is observing a beehive and counting the number of bees coming and going each day. The question is asking how many bees she saw returning to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, in the first 6 hours, she sees 30 bees leave the hive. Then, in the next 6 hours, she sees half as many bees returning. So, half of 30 is 15. That means 15 bees come back in the second 6-hour period.\n\nThen, in the next 6 hours (so that's the third 6-hour block), she sees twice as many bees leaving the hive as she did in the first 6 hours. The first time was 30 bees leaving, so twice that would be 60 bees leaving in the third period.\n\nNow, the next part says: \"Jede Biene, die davor weggeflogen und noch nicht zurückgekehrt war, kehrte dann in den nächsten 6 Stunden in den Bienenstock zurück.\" Translating that, it means every bee that had flown away before and hadn't returned yet came back in the next 6 hours. So, the last 6 hours (the fourth period) would have all the bees that had left previously but hadn't returned yet.\n\nSo, let's track the bees that have left and not returned yet. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst 6 hours: 30 bees leave. At this point, 30 bees have left and not returned yet.\n\nSecond 6 hours: 15 bees return. So, out of the initial 30 that left, 15 come back. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still away and haven't returned yet.\n\nThird 6 hours: 60 bees leave. Now, these are new bees leaving. So, the total number of bees that have left but not returned is the previous 15 (from the first period) plus the 60 that just left. So, 15 + 60 = 75 bees that are away and haven't returned yet.\n\nThen, in the next 6 hours (the fourth period), all of those 75 bees return. Therefore, Debra would see 75 bees returning in the last 6 hours.\n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. Let me rephrase:\n\n- First 6h: 30 leave. Total away: 30.\n- Next 6h: 15 return. So, 30 - 15 = 15 still away.\n- Next 6h: 60 leave. Now, total away is 15 + 60 = 75.\n- Then, in the last 6h, all 75 return. So, answer is 75?\n\nBut let me make sure there's no other interpretation. The problem says \"Jede Biene, die davor weggeflogen und noch nicht zurückgekehrt war, kehrte dann in den nächsten 6 Stunden in den Bienenstock zurück.\" So \"davor\" refers to before this last period. So, before the last 6 hours, which would be all the bees that had left in previous periods but hadn't returned yet. That would be the 15 from the first period that hadn't returned, plus the 60 that left in the third period. So yes, 15 + 60 = 75. Therefore, 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a misunderstanding about the timing? Let me check the timeline again:\n\n- First 6h: 30 leave.\n- Next 6h (second period): 15 return.\n- Next 6h (third period): 60 leave.\n- Next 6h (fourth period): all previous non-returning bees return.\n\nYes, that seems to be the structure. So the answer should be 75. Let me check if there's any other possible way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe the \"davor\" refers to before the third period? But no, the sentence says \"in den nächsten 6 Stunden\" (in the next 6 hours) after the third period. So the fourth period is after the third, and during that time, all bees that had flown away before (i.e., in the first, second, or third periods) but hadn't returned yet come back. Wait, but in the second period, 15 returned. So the ones that had flown away before (i.e., in the first period) but hadn't returned yet were 15. Then in the third period, 60 left.

If the total is $22, and she gave $30, then the change would be 30 - 22 = 8, which matches the problem statement. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is $30.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Maybe I overcomplicated it, but better safe than sorry. So the answer is 30 dollars.\n</think>\n\nBrittanys Mutter kaufte 1 Erwachsenenkarte (12 $) und 1 Kinderkarte (10 $).

So Steve and Tim are racing to see who gets home faster. Steve lives farther away, 3 miles from school, and he can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away and skates at 264 feet per minute. The question is, how long does the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how long each of them takes to get home. Then, the difference between their times will be how long the winner waits for the loser. But wait, the problem says \"wie lang wartet der Gewinner dann bei sich zu Hause, bevor der Verlierer das Rennen beendet?\" So, the winner arrives home first, and then waits until the loser arrives. So the time the winner waits is the difference between the loser's time and the winner's time.\n\nBut first, I need to convert the distances from miles to feet because their speeds are given in feet per minute. Let me recall that 1 mile is 5280 feet. So Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 3 * 5280 feet. Similarly, Tim's distance is 2 * 5280 feet.\n\nCalculating Steve's distance: 3 * 5280 = 15,840 feet. Tim's distance: 2 * 5280 = 10,560 feet.\n\nNow, time is distance divided by speed. So Steve's time is 15,840 feet divided by 440 feet per minute. Let me compute that. 15,840 / 440. Let's see, 440 * 36 = 15,840 because 440 * 30 = 13,200, 440 * 6 = 2,640; 13,200 + 2,640 = 15,840. So Steve takes 36 minutes.\n\nNow Tim's time: 10,560 feet divided by 264 feet per minute. Let me calculate that. 264 * 40 = 10,560. Because 264 * 10 = 2,640, so 2,640 * 4 = 10,560. So Tim takes 40 minutes.\n\nWait, so Steve takes 36 minutes, Tim takes 40 minutes. Therefore, Steve is the winner. He arrives home first. Then he waits until Tim arrives. The difference is 40 - 36 = 4 minutes. So the answer is 4 minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to be sure. For Steve: 3 miles is 3*5280=15,840 feet. Divided by 440 feet per minute. 15,840 / 440. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 10: 1584 / 44. Then divide numerator and denominator by 4: 396 / 11. 11*36=396. Yes, so 36 minutes. Correct.\n\nFor Tim: 2 miles is 10,560 feet. Divided by 264 feet per minute. 10,560 / 264. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 8: 10,560 /8=1320; 264 /8=33. So 1320 /33. 33*40=1320. So 40 minutes. Correct.\n\nSo the difference is 4 minutes. Therefore, the winner (Steve) waits 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes. So the answer is 4 minutes. That seems straightforward. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was converting miles to feet and then computing the time correctly.

Carl buys ten packages of cookies. Each package has six cookies. Each cookie costs 0.10 dollars. He pays with a 10-dollar bill. How much change does he get?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of cookies he's buying. Since there are ten packages and each has six cookies, that's 10 multiplied by 6. Let me calculate that: 10 * 6 = 60 cookies. So, he's buying 60 cookies in total.\n\nNext, each cookie costs 0.10 dollars. So, the total cost would be the number of cookies multiplied by the price per cookie. That's 60 * 0.10. Hmm, 60 times 0.10 is the same as 60 * 10 cents, which is 600 cents. Converting that back to dollars, 600 cents is 6 dollars. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 0.10 dollars per cookie, so 60 cookies would be 60 * 0.10 = 6.00 dollars. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total cost is $6.00. Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount paid. That's 10.00 - 6.00 = 4.00 dollars.

Carl buys ten packages of cookies. Each package has six cookies. Each cookie costs 0.10 dollars. He pays with a 10-dollar bill. How much change does he get?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of cookies he's buying. Since there are ten packages and each has six cookies, that's 10 multiplied by 6. Let me calculate that: 10 * 6 = 60 cookies. So, he's buying 60 cookies in total.\n\nNext, each cookie costs 0.10 dollars. So, the total cost would be the number of cookies multiplied by the price per cookie. That's 60 * 0.10. Hmm, 60 times 0.10 is the same as 60 * 10 cents, which is 600 cents. Converting that back to dollars, 600 cents is 6 dollars. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 0.10 dollars per cookie, so 60 cookies would be 60 * 0.10 = 6.00 dollars. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total cost is $6.00. Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount paid. That's 10.00 - 6.00 = 4.00 dollars. So, he should get $4.00 in change.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"zehn Kekspackungen\" which is ten packages. Each package has six cookies.

Hmm, the problem has several steps, so I need to break it down step by step. Let me start by listing out all the events and what happened with the fries each time.\n\nFirst, Dave bought a large bag of fries. Then he ate 14 of them before a seagull stole the bag. So, initially, there's some number of fries, let's call that number X. Dave eats 14, so the remaining fries after that would be X - 14.\n\nNext, the seagull lands and eats half as many as Dave had eaten. Dave ate 14, so half of that is 7. So the seagull eats 7 fries. That means after the seagull, the remaining fries would be (X - 14) - 7 = X - 21.\n\nThen, three pigeons come and push the seagull away. Each pigeon eats 3 fries. So three pigeons would eat 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Subtracting that from the remaining fries: (X - 21) - 9 = X - 30.\n\nAfter that, a raccoon steals two-thirds of the remaining fries. So if there were X - 30 fries left before the raccoon, the raccoon takes 2/3 of that. That means the remaining fries after the raccoon would be 1/3 of (X - 30). So that's (X - 30) * (1/3) = (X - 30)/3.\n\nThen, ants carry away one last fry, leaving 5 behind. So after the raccoon, there were (X - 30)/3 fries. The ants take 1, so the remaining is (X - 30)/3 - 1 = 5.\n\nNow, I can set up the equation:\n\n(X - 30)/3 - 1 = 5\n\nLet me solve this equation step by step. First, add 1 to both sides:\n\n(X - 30)/3 = 6\n\nThen multiply both sides by 3:\n\nX - 30 = 18\n\nThen add 30 to both sides:\n\nX = 48\n\nWait, so the original number of fries was 48? Let me check if that makes sense by going through each step again with X = 48.\n\nStart with 48 fries.\n\nDave eats 14: 48 - 14 = 34 left.\n\nSeagull eats half of 14, which is 7: 34 - 7 = 27 left.\n\nThree pigeons each eat 3: 3*3=9, so 27 - 9 = 18 left.\n\nRaccoon takes two-thirds of 18: 2/3 * 18 = 12, so remaining is 18 - 12 = 6.\n\nThen ants take 1, leaving 5. Which matches the problem statement. So yes, 48 seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the raccoon part again. If there were 18 fries before the raccoon, and the raccoon takes two-thirds, so 18 * (2/3) = 12 taken, leaving 6. Then ants take 1, leaving 5. That's correct. So the answer is 48.\n\nI think that's right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the steps. The equation setup seems correct.

Let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nRolls: 300 * 4 inches = 1200 inches. 1200 / 12 = 100 feet. Correct.\n\nCroissants: 120 * 6 inches = 720 inches. 720 / 12 = 60 feet. Correct.\n\nBaguettes: 60 * 2 feet = 120 feet. Correct.\n\nTotal: 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any units. The baguettes were already in feet, so no conversion needed there. The others were in inches, converted to feet. Yep, that's correct. So the total length is 280 feet.

So Blake and Kelly are having a race to see who can run the farthest in 15 minutes on a football field that's 100 yards long. The question is asking how much farther the winner runs compared to the loser. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how far each of them runs. Let me start with Blake. The problem says Blake runs 15 times back and forth. The football field is 100 yards long. So, when they say \"hin und zurück,\" that means going to the end and coming back, right? So each lap around the field would be going 100 yards to the end and then 100 yards back. So that's 200 yards per lap. If Blake does this 15 times, then his total distance would be 15 multiplied by 200 yards. Let me calculate that: 15 * 200 = 3000 yards. Okay, so Blake runs 3000 yards.\n\nNow, Kelly's part is a bit trickier. She first runs once back and forth, which is the same as Blake's first lap, right? So that's 100 yards there and 100 yards back, so 200 yards. Then she decides not to run next to Blake, so she starts running to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Wait, so the first time she runs once back and forth (the full 100 yards), and then she does 34 times the 40-yard line back and forth. Wait, does the 34 include the first one or is it in addition? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Kelly läuft einmal hin und zurück und beschließt dann, dass sie nicht neben Blake laufen will; also beginnt sie, zur 40-Yard-Linie und zurück zu laufen. Sie tut dies 34 Mal.\" So, she first runs once back and forth (the full 100 yards), and then she starts running to the 40-yard line and back, doing this 34 times. So the total for Kelly is 1 time of 200 yards (the first back and forth) plus 34 times of running to the 40-yard line and back. So each of those 34 times is 40 yards there and 40 yards back, which is 80 yards per lap. So 34 * 80 yards. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 34 * 80. Well, 30*80=2400, and 4*80=320, so total is 2400 + 320 = 2720 yards. Then add the initial 200 yards: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards. So Kelly runs 2920 yards in total.\n\nWait, but Blake ran 3000 yards. So Blake is the winner, and he ran 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards more than Kelly. So the answer would be 80 yards. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nBlake: 15 times back and forth on 100 yards. Each back and forth is 200 yards. 15*200=3000. That seems right.\n\nKelly: 1 time back and forth (200 yards) plus 34 times to the 40-yard line and back. Each of those is 40*2=80 yards. 34*80=2720. Then 2720 + 200 = 2920. Yes, that's correct. So 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards. So Blake wins by 80 yards.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem says \"15 Minuten\" but does the time affect the distance? Wait, the problem says they have 15 minutes to run as far as possible. But the question is about who runs farther, not about speed. So regardless of time, the total distance each ran is what's being compared. So even if they ran for the same amount of time, the one who ran more distance is the winner. So the answer is 80 yards.\n\nBut let me check again if I interpreted Kelly's running correctly. She first runs once back and forth (the full 100 yards), then she does 34 times to the 40-yard line and back. So that's 34 times. So total for Kelly is 200 + 34*80. Yes, that's 200 + 2720 = 2920. Blake is 3000. So difference is 80 yards. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. The original German says \"zur 40-Yard-Linie und zurück zu laufen. Sie tut dies 34 Mal.\" So \"zur 40-Yard-Linie und zurück\" is to the 40-yard line and back, so that's 40 yards there and 40 back, so 80 yards per loop. 34 loops would be 34*80. Then the initial one is 100 there and 100 back, 200. So total 2920. Blake is 3000. So 80 yards difference. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.

Finn is watching 11 tadpoles in a pond. Then he sees 6 of them come out from under a lily pad. After that, 2 of them disappear under a rock.

So maybe all 11 are visible initially. Then, 6 come out from under a lily pad. Wait, if they were hiding under the lily pad, then when they come out, they become visible again.

Maybe all 11 are visible at first. Then, 6 come out from under the lily pad. Wait, that might mean that those 6 were hiding and now they are visible.

Plötzlich sieht er 6 von ihnen aus dem Versteck unter einem Seerosenblatt kommen, dann sieht er 2 von ihnen unter einem Stein verschwinden. Wie viele Kaulquappen kann Finn jetzt im Teich sehen?\n\nSo, first, he observes 11 swimming tadpoles. Then, he sees 6 of them come out from a hiding place under a lily pad. Then, he sees 2 of them disappear under a rock. How many can he see now?\n\nSo, the key is whether the 6 that came out were previously hidden and thus not counted in the initial 11, or if they were part of the 11 that were already visible.\n\nIf the initial 11 are all visible, then when 6 come out from hiding, that would mean they were hidden before, so they were not part of the 11. But that would mean the total number of tadpoles is more than 11. But the problem doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the 6 were part of the 11 that were already visible, but they were hiding under the lily pad and then came out. Wait, but if they were already visible, why would they be hiding?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let's think of it as a math problem. Maybe the initial 11 are all visible. Then, 6 come out from hiding, which might mean they were hidden before, so they were not visible. So adding them to the visible count. Then, 2 disappear under a rock, so they are no longer visible. So the calculation would be: initial visible 11, plus 6 that come out (so 11 + 6 = 17), then minus 2 that disappear (17 - 2 = 15). But that would be 15. But that assumes that the 6 were not part of the initial 11. However, the problem says \"6 von ihnen\" (of them), meaning from the 11. So if they were part of the 11, then they were already visible, but they were hiding under the lily pad. So maybe they were hiding, so they were not visible, but then they come out, so they become visible again. So initially, 11 visible. Then, 6 were hiding, so they were not visible. Wait, but if they were part of the 11, then the initial count of 11 would include them, but if they were hiding, they wouldn't be visible. So maybe the initial 11 is the total number of tadpoles, and some are visible, some hidden. But the problem says \"Finn beobachtet 11 schwimmende Kaulquappen\", which translates to \"Finn observes 11 swimming tadpoles\". So maybe all 11 are visible at first. Then, 6 of them come out from a hiding place. Wait, but if they were already swimming, they wouldn't be hiding. Maybe the 6 were hiding under the lily pad and then come out to swim, so they become visible. So initially, there were 11 visible, but 6 were hiding under the lily pad. Wait, but that would mean the total number of tadpoles is 11 + 6 = 17? But the problem doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the 6 that came out were part of the 11 that were already visible, but they were hiding under the lily pad. So they were visible but hiding? That doesn't make sense. If they are hiding, they are not visible. So maybe the initial 11 includes both visible and hidden. But the problem says \"schwimmende\" (swimming), so maybe all 11 are swimming and visible. Then, 6 of them come out from a hiding place. Wait, that seems contradictory. If they are swimming, they can't be hiding under a lily pad. Maybe the 6 were hiding under the lily pad and then come out to swim, so they join the 11. So the total number of tadpoles would be 11 + 6 = 17, but the problem doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the 6 were part of the 11 that were already visible, but they were hiding under the lily pad, so they were not visible. So initially, 11 visible, but 6 were hiding, so the actual total is 11 + 6 = 17. Then, when they come out, they become visible, so visible becomes 11 + 6 = 17. Then, 2 disappear under a rock, so visible is 17 - 2 = 15. But this is assuming that the initial 11 visible includes some that are hiding, which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. The initial 11 are all visible. Then, 6 come out from hiding, which means they were not visible before, so adding 6 to the visible count. Then, 2 disappear, subtracting 2. So total visible is 11 + 6 - 2 = 15. But the problem says \"6 von ihnen\" (of them), meaning from the 11. So if they were part of the 11, then they were already visible, but they were hiding. That doesn't make sense. If they were hiding, they wouldn't be visible. So maybe the 6 were not part of the initial 11. But the problem says \"Finn beobachtet 11 schwimmende Kaulquappen... dann sieht er 6 von ihnen aus dem Versteck...\" So \"von ihnen\" refers to the 11. Therefore, the 6 were part of the 11. So they were hiding under the lily pad, which means they were not visible. So initially, there were 11 tadpoles, but 6 were hiding, so visible were 11 - 6 = 5. Then, they come out, so visible becomes 5 + 6 = 11. Then, 2 disappear under a rock, so visible is 11 - 2 = 9. But that would be 9. But this is assuming that the initial 11 includes both visible and hidden. However, the problem says \"Finn beobachtet 11 schwimmende Kaulquappen\", which might mean that all 11 are visible. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis is a common type of problem where the wording can be tricky. In many similar problems, when something comes out of hiding, it's added to the visible count, and when something disappears, it's subtracted. But the key is whether the 6 that came out were previously hidden and not counted in the initial 11 or part of the 11.\n\nIf we take the problem at face value: Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them (from the 11) come out from hiding. Wait, but if they were already visible, why would they be hiding? Maybe they were hiding under the lily pad and then come out to swim, so they were not visible before. So the initial 11 includes those 6 that were hiding. Wait, but if they were hiding, they wouldn't be part of the 11 visible. So maybe the total number of tadpoles is more than 11. But the problem doesn't mention that. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in German, and the translation might have nuances. \"Schwimmende Kaulquappen\" means swimming tadpoles, so they are visible. Then, 6 of them come out from a hiding place, which might mean they were hiding and now are visible. So if they were hiding, they were not part of the initial 11. So the initial 11 are visible, then 6 more come out, making 17, then 2 disappear, making 15. But the problem says \"6 von ihnen\" (of them), which refers to the 11. So that would mean the 6 were part of the 11. Therefore, they were hiding, so they were not visible. So initially, 11 tadpoles, but 6 were hiding, so visible were 5. Then, they come out, visible becomes 5 + 6 = 11. Then, 2 disappear, visible becomes 11 - 2 = 9. But this is assuming that the initial 11 includes both visible and hidden, which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be straightforward: initial 11, then 6 more appear (so 11 + 6 = 17), then 2 disappear (17 - 2 = 15). But the wording says \"6 von ihnen\" which would mean from the 11, not additional. So this is conflicting.\n\nI think the most logical interpretation is that the initial 11 are all visible. Then, 6 of them (from the 11) were hiding under the lily pad and come out, so they were not visible before. Wait, but if they were part of the 11, they should have been visible. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the problem might have a mistake, or the translation is off. Alternatively, maybe \"schwimmende\" doesn't mean all are visible, but that they are swimming, and some are hiding. But that's not clear.\n\nIn many similar math problems, when something comes out of hiding, it's added to the visible count, and when something disappears, it's subtracted. So if we take that approach, even if the wording is a bit confusing, the answer would be 11 + 6 - 2 = 15. But if the 6 were part of the 11, then it's 11 - 6 (hidden) + 6 (now visible) - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven that the problem is in German, and the translation might be precise, I think the intended answer is 11 + 6 - 2 = 15. Because the 6 are coming out from hiding, which would mean they were not visible before, so adding them to the initial 11. Then, 2 disappear, so subtract 2. So 15.

The problem is about calculating the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. The original price is 20 dollars. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out how many times the price increases in 36 months. Since the increase happens every two months, I can divide 36 by 2 to find the number of periods. That would be 18 periods. Wait, but each period is two months, so 36 divided by 2 is indeed 18. So there are 18 increases?\n\nWait, but hold on. The question says the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. So does that mean each time it's 20% of the original 20 dollars, or 20% of the current price? That's a crucial point. If it's 20% of the original price each time, then each increase is a fixed amount. But if it's 20% of the current price, then it's a compound increase. The wording says \"20 % des ursprünglichen Preises\", which translates to \"20% of the original price\". So that would be a fixed amount added each time, not a percentage of the current price. So that's different from compound interest, which is a percentage of the current amount.\n\nSo, original price is 20. Each two months, the price increases by 20% of 20, which is 4 dollars. So every two months, the price goes up by 4 dollars. Therefore, after each two-month period, the price is original price plus 4 dollars. So after 1 period (2 months), it's 20 + 4 = 24. After 2 periods (4 months), 24 + 4 = 28. And so on. So after n periods, the price would be 20 + 4n. Since there are 18 periods in 36 months, the price would be 20 + 4*18. Let me calculate that: 4*18 is 72, so 20 + 72 = 92. So the price after 36 months would be 92 dollars.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If the increase is 20% of the original price each time, then each increase is 20% of 20, which is 4. So every two months, add 4. So over 36 months, which is 18 two-month periods, adding 4 each time. So total increase is 18*4 = 72, added to original 20, gives 92. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut another way to think about it: if the problem had said the price increases by 20% every two months, meaning 20% of the current price, then it would be compound growth. But the problem specifically says \"20 % des ursprünglichen Preises\", so original price. So that's a linear increase, not exponential. So the answer is 92.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Suppose the original price is 20. After 2 months: 20 + 0.20*20 = 24. After 4 months: 24 + 0.20*20 = 28. After 6 months: 28 + 4 = 32. So each time, adding 4. So after 18 times, 20 + 18*4 = 92. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if it were 20% of the current price each time, then it would be 20*(1.2)^n, where n is the number of periods. But since the problem says 20% of the original price, it's not compounding. So the answer is 92.

If she does it herself, she loses 3 hours of freelance work. Her hourly rate is $35, so the lost income would be 3 hours multiplied by $35 per hour. Let me calculate that: 3 * 35 = $105.

So perhaps there's a misplacement in the translation.\n\nWait, maybe the original German is: \"Wenn Sally Four gleich alt ist wie Sally Thirtytwo und Sally Thirtytwo 8 Jahre älter, wie hoch ist dann das Gesamtalter der vier Vögel?\" So, the structure is: If Sally Four is as old as Sally Thirtytwo and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years older [than what?]. Maybe the original intended to say that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years older than Sally Four? But that would contradict the first part where they are the same age. Alternatively, maybe there's a missing part in the translation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the original is: \"Wenn Sally Four gleich alt ist wie Sally Thirtytwo und Sally Thirtytwo 8 Jahre älter als Sally Four ist, wie hoch ist dann das Gesamtalter der vier Vögel?\" But that would be redundant because if Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, then Sally Thirtytwo can't be 8 years older than Sally Four. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original meant that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years older than someone else, but the translation is missing that someone. For example, maybe \"Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years older than Granny Red\" or something else. But the user provided the question as is, so I have to work with that.\n\nWait, let's look again.

Billy needs to prepare 60 potatoes for his family barbecue. The question is asking how long it will take him to do all the peeling and cutting. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the time for each potato. The problem says it takes him one and a half minutes to peel each potato. Wait, one and a half minutes is 1 minute and 30 seconds, right? So that's 90 seconds per potato for peeling. Then, cutting each potato takes only 5 seconds. So for each potato, the total time is 90 seconds plus 5 seconds. That would be 95 seconds per potato.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Is there any chance that the peeling and cutting can be done in parallel? Like, maybe he can peel one potato while cutting another? But the problem doesn't mention anything about multitasking. It just says he's peeling and cutting each potato. So I think we have to assume that he does each potato one after the other, first peeling and then cutting. So for each potato, it's 90 seconds plus 5 seconds, totaling 95 seconds per potato.\n\nSo if he has 60 potatoes, then the total time would be 60 multiplied by 95 seconds. Let me calculate that. 60 times 95. Hmm, 60 times 100 is 6000, minus 60 times 5 which is 300, so 6000 - 300 = 5700 seconds. \n\nNow, converting that into minutes. Since 60 seconds make a minute, 5700 divided by 60. Let me do that division. 5700 divided by 60. Well, 60 times 95 is 5700, so that's 95 minutes. Wait, that's interesting. Because 60 potatoes times 95 seconds each is 5700 seconds, which is 95 minutes. So the total time is 95 minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's see: 95 seconds per potato. 60 potatoes. 95 * 60. Let's break it down. 90 * 60 = 5400 seconds, and 5 * 60 = 300 seconds. So 5400 + 300 = 5700 seconds. Yes, that's correct. Then 5700 divided by 60 is indeed 95 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in hours and minutes? 95 minutes is 1 hour and 35 minutes. But the question just asks for the time, so either 95 minutes or 1 hour 35 minutes. But since the original times were given in minutes and seconds, probably 95 minutes is acceptable. \n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. It says \"eineinhalb Minuten\" for peeling, which is 1.5 minutes, and 5 seconds for cutting. So per potato, 1.5 minutes plus 5 seconds. But 1.5 minutes is 90 seconds, so 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. So that's correct. \n\nAnother way: 1.5 minutes per potato for peeling. So 1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes. Then 5 seconds per potato for cutting. 5 seconds * 60 = 300 seconds. Convert that to minutes: 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. So total time is 90 + 5 = 95 minutes. Yep, same result. \n\nSo the answer should be 95 minutes. That seems straightforward. I don't see any tricks here. The key is to convert all times to the same unit, either all seconds or all minutes.

The problem is about a race with 240 Asians. Out of these, 80 are Japanese, and the rest are Chinese. Then, it says that the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60, and we need to find out how many girls are in the Chinese team. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many Chinese people there are in total. The total number of participants is 240, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the Chinese would be the remaining number. Let me calculate that: 240 minus 80 equals 160. So, there are 160 Chinese participants.\n\nNow, the question is about the Chinese team. It mentions that there are 60 boys in the Chinese team. But wait, does the problem specify that all the Chinese participants are in a team? Or is the team a subset of the Chinese participants? The wording says \"im chinesischen Team,\" which translates to \"in the Chinese team.\" So, maybe the entire Chinese group is considered as a team, and within that team, there are 60 boys. Therefore, the rest of the Chinese participants would be girls.\n\nBut hold on, the problem doesn't mention anything about girls in the Chinese team directly. It just gives the number of boys. So, if the total number of Chinese is 160, and 60 of them are boys, then the number of girls would be 160 minus 60. That would be 100. So, the answer should be 100 girls.\n\nWait, but is there any chance that the problem is referring to a different team? Like, maybe there are multiple teams, and the Chinese team is separate from the Japanese team? But the problem doesn't mention any other teams. It just says there are 240 Asians, 80 Japanese, and the rest Chinese. Then, focusing on the Chinese team, which has 60 boys. So, unless there's more information, I think the straightforward approach is correct.\n\nLet me check again. Total participants: 240. Japanese: 80. Therefore, Chinese: 240 - 80 = 160. Chinese team has 60 boys. Assuming that the Chinese team consists of all Chinese participants, then girls would be 160 - 60 = 100. That seems right.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. For example, maybe the problem is in German, and \"im chinesischen Team\" could be interpreted differently? But I think the translation is accurate. The problem is straightforward: total Chinese is 160, boys are 60, so girls are 100. I don't see any other factors mentioned, like some Chinese people not being in the team or something. The problem states \"in einen Rennen mit 240 Asiaten waren 80 Japaner und der Rest waren Chinesen.\" So, the rest (160) are Chinese. Then, \"die Anzahl Jungen im chinesischen Team 60 betrug,\" so the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60.

Zaid earns $6000 a month. He has several expenses and donations. I need to figure out how much he has left after all of that. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he gives 1/4 of his salary for rent. So, 1/4 of 6000. Let me calculate that. 6000 divided by 4 is 1500. So rent is $1500.\n\nNext, he spends 1/3 of his salary on gasoline for his car. That would be 1/3 of 6000. Let me do that division. 6000 divided by 3 is 2000. So gasoline costs him $2000.\n\nNow, after paying rent and gas, he has some money left. Let me find out how much that is. Total salary is 6000. Subtract rent (1500) and gas (2000). So 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500. So he has $2500 remaining after rent and gas.\n\nThen, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Half of 2500 is 1250. So he donates $1250 to charity.\n\nAfter that, he gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses and his wife $700 for groceries and household items. So that's 200 + 700 = $900.\n\nNow, let's add up all his expenses and donations. Rent: 1500, gas: 2000, charity: 1250, daughter: 200, wife: 700. Let me sum those up.\n\n1500 + 2000 = 3500. Then 3500 + 1250 = 4750. Then 4750 + 200 = 4950. Then 4950 + 700 = 5650. So total expenses and donations are $5650.\n\nWait, but his total salary is $6000. So subtracting 5650 from 6000 gives 350. Hmm, but let me check again because maybe I made a mistake in the steps.\n\nWait, let me recheck each step. First, rent is 1/4 of 6000: 6000/4 = 1500. Correct. Gas is 1/3: 6000/3 = 2000. Correct. Then remaining after rent and gas: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500. Correct. Then he donates half of that, which is 1250. Then he gives 200 to daughter and 700 to wife. So total after donations and those gifts: 1250 + 200 + 700 = 2150. Then total expenses: 1500 + 2000 + 2150 = 5650. So 6000 - 5650 = 350. So he has $350 left. But let me check again because sometimes when you do step-by-step, you might have miscalculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should track the remaining amount after each step. Let's try that approach.\n\nStart with $6000.\n\nAfter rent: 6000 - 1500 = 4500.\n\nAfter gas: 4500 - 2000 = 2500.\n\nThen he donates half of the remaining, which is 2500 / 2 = 1250. So after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250.\n\nThen he gives 200 to daughter and 700 to wife. So total given to them is 200 + 700 = 900. So subtract that from 1250: 1250 - 900 = 350. So yes, same result. So he has $350 left.\n\nWait, but let me check if the donation is half of the remaining after rent and gas, which is 2500. So half is 1250. Then after that, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 left. Then he gives 200 + 700 = 900. So 1250 - 900 = 350. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe the problem is in the interpretation of the donation. The question says: \"spendet die Hälfte des verbleibenden Betrags an seine bevorzugte karitative Einrichtung.\" So \"spendet die Hälfte des verbleibenden Betrags\" – \"donates half of the remaining amount.\" So after rent and gas, the remaining is 2500. Then he donates half of that, so 1250. Then the remaining after donation is 1250. Then he gives 200 to daughter and 700 to wife. So total of 900. So 1250 - 900 = 350. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that after donating, he still has 1250, and then gives 200 and 700. So 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350. So that's the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $350. But let me check once again with another method.\n\nTotal salary: 6000.\n\nTotal spent on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500.\n\nTotal spent on gas: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000.\n\nTotal spent on charity: 1/2 * (6000 - 1500 - 2000) = 1/2 * 2500 = 1250.\n\nThen, 200 to daughter and 700 to wife: 900.\n\nTotal expenses: 1500 + 2000 + 1250 + 900 = 5650.\n\n6000 - 5650 = 350.

Let's say:\n\n- Let J be Jean's current age.\n- Let M be Mark's current age.\n- Let Ja be Jan's current age.\n\nFrom the first statement: Jean is two years older than Mark. So, J = M + 2. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part: Two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age. Let's parse that. Two years ago, Mark's age would have been M - 2. At that time, Jan's age would have been Ja - 2. But the problem says that two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age. So, the equation here would be:\n\nM - 2 = (1/2)(Ja - 2) + 5\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure. The wording is \"Mark war 5 Jahre älter als die Hälfte des Alters von Jan.\" So, \"Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.\" So, that would be Mark's age = (half of Jan's age) + 5. So, yes, M - 2 = (1/2)(Ja - 2) + 5. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check the translation again. \"Vor zwei Jahren war Mark 5 Jahre älter als die Hälfte des Alters von Jan.\" So, two years ago, Mark's age was equal to (half of Jan's age at that time) plus 5. So, yes, that seems right. So, M - 2 = 5 + (1/2)(Ja - 2). Alternatively, M - 2 = (Ja - 2)/2 + 5.\n\nBut let me confirm. If someone is \"5 years older than X,\" that means their age is X + 5. So, if Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago, then Mark's age at that time is (half of Jan's age then) + 5. So, yes, that equation is correct.\n\nNow, we know that Jan is currently 30, so Ja = 30. Therefore, two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. So, substituting into the equation:\n\nM - 2 = (28)/2 + 5\n\nCalculating that: 28 divided by 2 is 14, plus 5 is 19. So, M - 2 = 19. Therefore, solving for M: M = 19 + 2 = 21. So, Mark is currently 21 years old.\n\nThen, since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23. Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the steps.\n\nFirst, Jan is 30 now. Two years ago, Jan was 28. Half of that is 14. Then, Mark was 5 years older than that, so 14 + 5 = 19. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 19, so now he is 19 + 2 = 21. Then Jean is 21 + 2 = 23. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if the equation was set up correctly. The problem says \"Vor zwei Jahren war Mark 5 Jahre älter als die Hälfte des Alters von Jan.\" So, two years ago, Mark's age = (half of Jan's age at that time) + 5. So, yes, that's exactly what I did. So, M - 2 = (Ja - 2)/2 + 5. Plugging in Ja = 30, we get M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19, so M = 21. Then Jean is 23. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another approach. Let's see.\n\nIf Jan is 30 now, two years ago she was 28. Half of that is 14. Mark was 5 years older than that, so 14 + 5 = 19. So, Mark was 19 two years ago, so now he is 21. Jean is two years older than Mark, so 21 + 2 = 23. Yep, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be 23.\n</think>\n\nJean ist zwei Jahre älter als Mark.

There's a 4x400 meter relay race between two teams. I need to figure out by how many seconds the faster team will win. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, Team A is very balanced. Each of their four runners will run their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. So, the total time for Team A is straightforward: 4 runners * 55 seconds each. That would be 4 * 55 = 220 seconds. Got that.\n\nNow, Team B is less balanced. Their first runner takes 60 seconds. Then each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner is 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner is 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner is 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. Let me check that again. First runner: 60, second: 57, third: 54, fourth: 51. Yeah, that seems right. Each time subtracting 3 seconds.\n\nSo, adding up Team B's total time: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51. Let me calculate that. 60 + 57 is 117, then 54 + 51 is 105. So total is 117 + 105 = 222 seconds. Wait, that's 222 seconds for Team B.\n\nTeam A's total time is 220 seconds. So, Team A is faster by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds. Therefore, Team A would win by 2 seconds. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my math to be sure.\n\nFor Team B: 60, 57, 54, 51. Let's add them one by one. 60 + 57 = 117. Then 117 + 54 = 171. Then 171 + 51 = 222. Yes, that's correct. Team A: 55 * 4 = 220. So difference is 2 seconds. So the answer should be 2 seconds.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again. The question says \"Um wie viele Sekunden wird das schnellere Team ausgehend von diesen Informationen gewinnen?\" So, \"By how many seconds will the faster team win?\" So, if Team A is faster, then they win by 2 seconds. That seems right.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, in relay races, sometimes the baton exchange can affect the time, but the problem doesn't mention anything about that. It just says each runner runs 400 meters, so I think we can assume that the total time is just the sum of each runner's individual times. So, no need to consider baton exchanges or anything else here.\n\nAnother thing: the problem says \"Standard-Strecke\" which is a standard track, so 400 meters per lap. But since each runner runs 400 meters, that's one lap each. So, no issues there. The times given are for each runner's 400 meters, so adding them up is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. Team A's total time is 220 seconds, Team B's is 222 seconds.

The question is asking: Jerry rolls a six-sided die. How much more likely (in percentage terms) is it that he rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row? Hmm, okay. So I need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and then compare it to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then express the difference as a percentage. Wait, actually, the wording is a bit confusing. It says \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... dass er eine Zahl größer als 3 wirft als zwei gerade Zahlen hintereinander?\" So, in English, that would be \"How much more likely is it that he rolls a number greater than 3 than rolling two even numbers in a row?\" So, I think it's asking for the difference in probabilities between the two events, expressed as a percentage. But I need to be careful here.\n\nFirst, let's break down the two events:\n\n1. Rolling a number greater than 3 on a single die roll.\n2. Rolling two even numbers in a row (i.e., two consecutive rolls, both even).\n\nWait, but the question says \"zwei gerade Zahlen hintereinander\" which translates to \"two even numbers in a row.\" So, that would be two separate rolls, right? So, the first event is a single roll, the second is two rolls. But the question is comparing the probability of the first event to the probability of the second event. So, the question is: What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 (let's call this P(A)) compared to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row (P(B)), and how much more likely is P(A) than P(B) in percentage terms?\n\nSo, first, let's compute P(A). A six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6. Numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, 6. So that's 3 outcomes. Therefore, P(A) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nNow, P(B) is the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Assuming that each roll is independent, the probability of getting an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2, since the even numbers are 2, 4, 6. Therefore, the probability of getting two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nNow, the question is asking how much more likely is P(A) than P(B). So, the difference in probabilities is P(A) - P(B) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. But the question says \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... in Prozent ausgedrückt.\" So, how much more likely in percentage terms. Hmm. So, is it asking for the absolute difference in percentage points, or the relative difference as a percentage?\n\nWait, if it's asking \"how much more likely,\" that could be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1. The absolute difference: P(A) - P(B) = 25% (since 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25, which is 25 percentage points).\n\n2. The relative difference: (P(A) - P(B)) / P(B) * 100% = (0.25 / 0.25) * 100% = 100%. So, P(A) is 100% more likely than P(B).\n\nBut the question is in German, and the phrasing is \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... als...\" which is a bit ambiguous. However, in probability questions, when they ask \"how much more likely,\" it's often the relative difference. But I need to check the exact wording again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es (in Prozent ausgedrückt), dass er eine Zahl größer als 3 wirft als zwei gerade Zahlen hintereinander?\"\n\nTranslating: \"How much more likely (expressed in percentage) is it that he rolls a number greater than 3 than rolling two even numbers in a row?\"\n\nSo, the structure is \"how much more likely is A than B,\" which in probability terms is usually the relative difference. For example, if A is twice as likely as B, then it's 100% more likely. But sometimes, people might interpret it as the absolute difference. However, given that the answer is expected in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25 percentage points, but the relative difference is 100%, which is a more significant percentage.\n\nBut let's think about the possible answers. If the answer is 25%, that would be the absolute difference. If it's 100%, that's the relative difference. Which one is correct?\n\nIn probability, when someone says \"how much more likely,\" it's often the relative difference. For example, if event A has a 50% chance and event B has a 25% chance, then A is twice as likely as B, which is a 100% increase in probability. However, in some contexts, people might just say the difference in percentages. But given that the question is from a math problem, it's more likely to be the relative difference.\n\nBut let's check with an example. Suppose P(A) is 50% and P(B) is 25%. The question is \"how much more likely is A than B?\" If you say \"25 percentage points more likely,\" that's correct. If you say \"100% more likely,\" that's also correct in terms of relative increase. However, in some contexts, \"how much more likely\" can be ambiguous. But since the answer is to be given in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25%, which is a percentage point difference, whereas the relative difference is 100%, which is a percentage increase.\n\nBut in German, the phrasing might be more precise. Let me think. The question is \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... als...\" which is \"how much more likely is it... than...\" In German, this is often interpreted as the relative difference. For example, if something is twice as likely, you say \"es ist doppelt so wahrscheinlich.\" But if you say \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher,\" it's more like \"how much more likely in terms of percentage,\" which could be the relative difference.\n\nBut to be safe, let's check both possibilities.\n\nIf the answer is 25%, that's the absolute difference. If it's 100%, that's the relative difference. However, in the context of the problem, since both probabilities are given as percentages (50% and 25%), the absolute difference is 25 percentage points. However, the question says \"in Prozent ausgedrückt,\" which is \"expressed in percentage.\" If they wanted the absolute difference, they might have said \"in Prozentpunkten\" (percentage points). But since they said \"in Prozent,\" it's more likely they want the relative difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of the two probabilities, expressed as a percentage. For example, P(A)/P(B) = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2, which is 200%, so A is 200% as likely as B, which would mean 100% more likely. But that's the same as the relative difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"how much more likely is A than B,\" which is (P(A) - P(B))/P(B) * 100% = 100%.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think of another example. If P(A) is 30% and P(B) is 10%, then \"how much more likely is A than B?\" The absolute difference is 20 percentage points, the relative difference is 200% (since 30 is 200% more than 10). So, in that case, the answer would be 200% more likely.\n\nTherefore, in our case, since P(A) is 50% and P(B) is 25%, the relative difference is (50 - 25)/25 * 100% = 100%. So, the answer would be 100%.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the question is indeed asking for the relative difference. However, in some contexts, people might just take the absolute difference. But given that the answer is to be in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25%, which is a percentage point difference, but the relative difference is 100%, which is a percentage increase.\n\nBut in German, the term \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher\" could be interpreted as \"by what percentage is A more likely than B,\" which would be the relative difference. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But given that the answer is expected in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25%, which is a percentage point, but the relative difference is 100%, which is a percentage increase.\n\nWait, but the question says \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... in Prozent ausgedrückt,\" which is \"how much more likely is it... expressed in percentage.\" So, if you take \"wie viel\" as \"how much,\" then it's the absolute difference in percentage terms. But percentage points are different from percentages. For example, if something increases from 25% to 50%, that's an increase of 25 percentage points, or 100% in relative terms.\n\nBut the question is in German, and in German, \"in Prozent\" would typically refer to the relative difference, not the absolute. However, I'm not 100% sure. Let me check with an example. If someone says \"Wie viel Prozent mehr ist 50 als 25?\" the answer would be 100%, because 50 is 100% more than 25. So, in that case, it's the relative difference. Therefore, if the question is \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... in Prozent,\" it's likely referring to the relative difference, which is 100%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 100%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check both interpretations.\n\nIf the question is asking for the absolute difference in percentage points, then it's 50% - 25% = 25 percentage points. But the question says \"in Prozent ausgedrückt,\" which would be 25% if they mean percentage points, but that's not standard. Usually, percentage points are specified as \"Prozentpunkte.\" So, if they just say \"in Prozent,\" it's more likely the relative difference.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 100%.\n\nBut let me verify once more. Suppose the probability of A is 50%, and the probability of B is 25%. The question is \"how much more likely is A than B?\" If you say \"A is 100% more likely than B,\" that means A is twice as likely as B. Which is correct because 50% is twice 25%. So, the relative increase is 100%.\n\nAlternatively, if you say \"A is 25% more likely than B,\" that would mean A is 25% more than B, which would be 25% + 25% of 25% = 31.25%, which is not the case here. Therefore, the correct relative increase is 100%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 100%.\n\nBut to make sure, let's check the exact calculation:\n\nRelative difference = (P(A) - P(B)) / P(B) * 100% = (0.5 - 0.25) / 0.25 * 100% = 0.25 / 0.25 * 100% = 1 * 100% = 100%.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the answer is 100%.\n\nBut wait, the original question is in German, and sometimes in German, the phrasing might be different. However, based on standard probability terminology, this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 100%.\n</think>\n\nJerry wirft einen sechsseitigen Würfel.

The question is asking: Jerry rolls a six-sided die. How much more likely (in percentage terms) is it that he rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row? Hmm, okay. So I need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and then compare it to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then express the difference as a percentage. Wait, actually, the wording is a bit confusing. It says \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... dass er eine Zahl größer als 3 wirft als zwei gerade Zahlen hintereinander?\" So, in English, that would be \"How much more likely is it that he rolls a number greater than 3 than rolling two even numbers in a row?\" So, I think it's asking for the difference in probabilities between the two events, expressed as a percentage. But I need to be careful here.\n\nFirst, let's break down the two events:\n\n1. Rolling a number greater than 3 on a single die roll.\n2. Rolling two even numbers in a row (i.e., two consecutive rolls, both even).\n\nWait, but the question says \"zwei gerade Zahlen hintereinander\" which translates to \"two even numbers in a row.\" So, that would be two separate rolls, right? So, the first event is a single roll, the second is two rolls. But the question is comparing the probability of the first event to the probability of the second event. So, the question is: What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 (let's call this P(A)) compared to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row (P(B)), and how much more likely is P(A) than P(B) in percentage terms?\n\nSo, first, let's compute P(A). A six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6. Numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, 6. So that's 3 outcomes. Therefore, P(A) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nNow, P(B) is the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Assuming that each roll is independent, the probability of getting an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2, since the even numbers are 2, 4, 6. Therefore, the probability of getting two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nNow, the question is asking how much more likely is P(A) than P(B). So, the difference in probabilities is P(A) - P(B) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. But the question says \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... in Prozent ausgedrückt.\" So, how much more likely in percentage terms. Hmm. So, is it asking for the absolute difference in percentage points, or the relative difference as a percentage?\n\nWait, if it's asking \"how much more likely,\" that could be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1. The absolute difference: P(A) - P(B) = 25% (since 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25, which is 25 percentage points).\n\n2. The relative difference: (P(A) - P(B)) / P(B) * 100% = (0.25 / 0.25) * 100% = 100%. So, P(A) is 100% more likely than P(B).\n\nBut the question is in German, and the phrasing is \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... als...\" which is a bit ambiguous. However, in probability questions, when they ask \"how much more likely,\" it's often the relative difference. But I need to check the exact wording again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es (in Prozent ausgedrückt), dass er eine Zahl größer als 3 wirft als zwei gerade Zahlen hintereinander?\"\n\nTranslating: \"How much more likely (expressed in percentage) is it that he rolls a number greater than 3 than rolling two even numbers in a row?\"\n\nSo, the structure is \"how much more likely is A than B,\" which in probability terms is usually the relative difference. For example, if A is twice as likely as B, then it's 100% more likely. But sometimes, people might interpret it as the absolute difference. However, given that the answer is expected in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25 percentage points, but the relative difference is 100%, which is a more significant percentage.\n\nBut let's think about the possible answers. If the answer is 25%, that would be the absolute difference. If it's 100%, that's the relative difference. Which one is correct?\n\nIn probability, when someone says \"how much more likely,\" it's often the relative difference. For example, if event A has a 50% chance and event B has a 25% chance, then A is twice as likely as B, which is a 100% increase in probability. However, in some contexts, people might just say the difference in percentages. But given that the question is from a math problem, it's more likely to be the relative difference.\n\nBut let's check with an example. Suppose P(A) is 50% and P(B) is 25%. The question is \"how much more likely is A than B?\" If you say \"25 percentage points more likely,\" that's correct. If you say \"100% more likely,\" that's also correct in terms of relative increase. However, in some contexts, \"how much more likely\" can be ambiguous. But since the answer is to be given in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25%, which is a percentage point difference, whereas the relative difference is 100%, which is a percentage increase.\n\nBut in German, the phrasing might be more precise. Let me think. The question is \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... als...\" which is \"how much more likely is it... than...\" In German, this is often interpreted as the relative difference. For example, if something is twice as likely, you say \"es ist doppelt so wahrscheinlich.\" But if you say \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher,\" it's more like \"how much more likely in terms of percentage,\" which could be the relative difference.\n\nBut to be safe, let's check both possibilities.\n\nIf the answer is 25%, that's the absolute difference. If it's 100%, that's the relative difference. However, in the context of the problem, since both probabilities are given as percentages (50% and 25%), the absolute difference is 25 percentage points. However, the question says \"in Prozent ausgedrückt,\" which is \"expressed in percentage.\" If they wanted the absolute difference, they might have said \"in Prozentpunkten\" (percentage points). But since they said \"in Prozent,\" it's more likely they want the relative difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of the two probabilities, expressed as a percentage. For example, P(A)/P(B) = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2, which is 200%, so A is 200% as likely as B, which would mean 100% more likely. But that's the same as the relative difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"how much more likely is A than B,\" which is (P(A) - P(B))/P(B) * 100% = 100%.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think of another example. If P(A) is 30% and P(B) is 10%, then \"how much more likely is A than B?\" The absolute difference is 20 percentage points, the relative difference is 200% (since 30 is 200% more than 10). So, in that case, the answer would be 200% more likely.\n\nTherefore, in our case, since P(A) is 50% and P(B) is 25%, the relative difference is (50 - 25)/25 * 100% = 100%. So, the answer would be 100%.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the question is indeed asking for the relative difference. However, in some contexts, people might just take the absolute difference. But given that the answer is to be in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25%, which is a percentage point difference, but the relative difference is 100%, which is a percentage increase.\n\nBut in German, the term \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher\" could be interpreted as \"by what percentage is A more likely than B,\" which would be the relative difference.

However, I'm not 100% sure. Let me check with an example. If someone says \"Wie viel Prozent mehr ist 50 als 25?\" the answer would be 100%, because 50 is 100% more than 25.

So, Russell is distributing straw to different animals in the pet store. The question is asking how many rats are in each cage. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, there are three cages for rats, and they're kept in equal-sized groups. Each rat gets 6 straws. Then there are 10 hamster cages, each hamster is alone, so each hamster gets 5 straws. There's also a rabbit hutch where 20 straws are given out. The total number of straws given to the small rodents is 160. We need to find out how many rats are in each cage.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"kleine Nagetiere\" which translates to small rodents. So, that would include the rats and the hamsters, right? The rabbits are probably not considered rodents here, so the 20 straws for the rabbits are separate. So the total straws given to the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. The rabbits are in their own hutch with 20 straws, which isn't part of the 160.\n\nSo, let's structure this:\n\nTotal straws for small rodents (rats and hamsters) = 160.\n\nRats are in 3 cages, each cage has the same number of rats. Let's call the number of rats per cage \"x\". Therefore, total rats = 3x. Each rat gets 6 straws, so total straws for rats = 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nHamsters: 10 cages, each with 1 hamster. So total hamsters = 10. Each hamster gets 5 straws, so total straws for hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nSo total straws for rats and hamsters is 18x + 50 = 160.\n\nTherefore, solving for x:\n\n18x + 50 = 160\n\nSubtract 50 from both sides:\n\n18x = 110\n\nThen x = 110 / 18\n\nWait, that gives a decimal. Hmm, 110 divided by 18 is approximately 6.111... But the number of rats should be a whole number. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nLet me check the problem again. The question says \"die Ratten werden in 3 Käfigen in gleich großen Gruppen gehalten\" which means the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal-sized groups. So each cage has the same number of rats. So total rats is 3 times the number per cage. Each rat gets 6 straws. Hamsters are 10 cages, each with 1 hamster, so 10 hamsters. Each hamster gets 5 straws. The total straws for small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. The rabbits have 20 straws, which are separate.\n\nSo the equation is 18x + 50 = 160. Then 18x = 110. Hmm, 110 divided by 18 is 6.111... That's not a whole number. That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says \"unter den Nagetieren\" which are the rodents, so the rabbits are not rodents. So the 160 straws are only for the rats and hamsters. The rabbits are separate. So the calculation should be correct. But getting a fractional number of rats doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a miscalculation.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nTotal straws for rats: 3 cages, each with x rats, so 3x rats. Each rat gets 6 straws: 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nTotal straws for hamsters: 10 hamsters, each gets 5 straws: 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nTotal straws for rodents: 18x + 50 = 160.\n\nSo 18x = 160 - 50 = 110.\n\nx = 110 / 18 = 5.555... Wait, that's still not a whole number. That's strange. Maybe the problem has a typo, or I misread something.\n\nWait, the problem says \"die Ratten werden in 3 Käfigen in gleich großen Gruppen gehalten\" – so the rats are in 3 cages, each with the same number of rats. So total rats is 3 times the number per cage. But maybe the problem is in German, and \"gleich großen Gruppen\" could mean that each group is the same size, but maybe the total number of rats is divided into 3 groups, each group being a cage. So that's the same as 3x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the total straws given to the small rodents is 160, which includes the rabbits? Wait, the problem says \"überall sonst im Laden wird kein Stroh verteilt\" – so only the rats, hamsters, and rabbits get straws. But the question says \"160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteilt wurden\" – so the 160 is only for the small rodents, which are rats and hamsters. The rabbits are in their own hutch with 20 straws, which are not part of the 160. So the equation should be correct.\n\nBut 110 divided by 18 is not a whole number. That suggests that either the problem has an error, or I have a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. The problem says:\n\n- Rats in 3 cages, equal groups. Each rat gets 6 straws.\n\n- 10 hamster cages, each with 1 hamster. Each hamster gets 5 straws.\n\n- 1 rabbit hutch with 20 straws.\n\nTotal straws for small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160.\n\nSo, total straws for rats: 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nTotal straws for hamsters: 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nTotal: 18x + 50 = 160.\n\nSo 18x = 110.\n\nx = 110 / 18 ≈ 6.111...\n\nHmm. That's not possible. Maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to all animals (including rabbits) is 160? Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe original question says: \"Wenn 160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteilt wurden, wie viele Ratten sind dann in jedem Käfig?\"\n\nSo \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\" – which would be among the small rodents. So that would be rats and hamsters. The rabbits are not rodents, so their 20 straws are separate. Therefore, the 160 is only for rats and hamsters. So the equation is correct.\n\nBut the answer is not a whole number. That's a problem. Maybe the problem has a typo. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated 160 - 50. 160 - 50 is 110. Yes. 18x = 110. So x = 110/18 = 5.555... That's not possible. Maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to all animals (including rabbits) is 160? Let's try that.\n\nIf total straws including rabbits is 160, then:\n\nStraws for rats: 18x\n\nStraws for hamsters: 50\n\nStraws for rabbits: 20\n\nTotal: 18x + 50 + 20 = 18x + 70 = 160\n\nThen 18x = 90\n\nx = 5\n\nThat would make sense. So maybe the problem had a translation error, and the 160 includes the rabbits. But the original question says \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\", which are the small rodents, so rabbits are not included. But if that's the case, then the answer is not a whole number, which is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that the total straws given to all animals is 160, and the rabbits are part of that. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Wenn 160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteilt wurden, wie viele Ratten sind dann in jedem Käfig?\"\n\nSo \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\" – among the small rodents. So rabbits are not included. Therefore, the 160 is only for rats and hamsters. So the equation is 18x + 50 = 160, leading to x = 110/18 ≈ 6.11. That's not possible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem or in my interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the total straws given to all animals (including rabbits) is 160. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Es gibt auch einen Hasenstall, in dem 20 Strohhalme unter den Hasen verteilt werden. Überall sonst in dem Laden wird kein Stroh verteilt. Wenn 160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteilt wurden...\"\n\nSo the 20 straws for the rabbits are separate. The 160 is for the small rodents (rats and hamsters). So the equation is correct. But the answer is not a whole number. That's a problem. Maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to all animals is 160, including the rabbits. Let's try that.\n\nTotal straws: 18x (rats) + 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 18x + 70 = 160\n\nThen 18x = 90 => x = 5. That would make sense. So maybe the original problem had a translation error, and the 160 includes the rabbits. But according to the German text, it's \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\", which are the small rodents, so rabbits are not included. Therefore, the problem might have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I misread the number of straws given to the hamsters or rats.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"jeder Ratte 6 Strohhalme gegeben. Es gibt 10 Käfige von Hamstern, die allein gehalten werden, und jedem Hamster werden 5 Strohhalme gegeben.\"\n\nSo that's correct. Each rat gets 6, each hamster gets 5. So the numbers are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that the total straws given to the small rodents is 160, which includes the rabbits. But that would be incorrect because rabbits are not rodents. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. Maybe \"unter den Nagetieren\" includes the rabbits? But in German, \"Nagetiere\" are rodents, and rabbits are \"Kaninchen\", which are not rodents. So that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to all animals is 160, and the 20 straws for the rabbits are part of that. Let's try that.\n\nTotal straws: 18x (rats) + 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 18x + 70 = 160\n\nThen 18x = 90 => x = 5. That would make sense. So maybe the original problem had a translation error, and the 160 includes the rabbits. But according to the given text, it's \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\", which are the small rodents, so rabbits are not included. Therefore, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that the total straws given to the small rodents is 160, which includes the rabbits. But that would be incorrect. However, if we proceed with that, we get a whole number. Maybe the problem intended that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo in the number of straws. For example, if the total straws for small rodents is 160, and the hamsters are 10 with 5 each, that's 50. Then 160 - 50 = 110 for the rats. 110 divided by 6 is about 18.333 rats total, which would be 6.111 per cage. Still not a whole number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that each rat gets 5 straws instead of 6? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"jeder Ratte 6 Strohhalme gegeben.\" So that's 6 per rat. Hamsters get 5 each. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. This is perplexing. Maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 5.555... but that's not possible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's numbers. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. Let's assume that the total straws given to the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. So:\n\nTotal straws for rats: 6 * number of rats\n\nTotal straws for hamsters: 5 * 10 = 50\n\nSo 6 * number of rats + 50 = 160\n\nTherefore, 6 * number of rats = 110\n\nNumber of rats = 110 / 6 ≈ 18.333\n\nBut the number of rats must be a whole number. So this suggests that the problem has an inconsistency. Unless the number of straws per rat is different.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that each rat gets 5 straws, and each hamster gets 6? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal: \"jeder Ratte 6 Strohhalme gegeben. Es gibt 10 Käfige von Hamstern, die allein gehalten werden, und jedem Hamster werden 5 Strohhalme gegeben.\"\n\nNo, it's 6 for rats, 5 for hamsters. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of hamsters is different. The problem says 10 cages of hamsters, each alone. So 10 hamsters. That's correct.\n\nHmm. This is really confusing. Maybe the problem is from a source that has a typo. If we assume that the total straws for small rodents is 160, and the answer is 5 rats per cage, then:\n\nNumber of rats = 3 * 5 = 15\n\nStraws for rats: 15 * 6 = 90\n\nStraws for hamsters: 10 * 5 = 50\n\nTotal: 90 + 50 = 140, which is not 160. So that's not matching.\n\nIf the answer is 6 rats per cage:\n\nNumber of rats = 3 * 6 = 18\n\nStraws for rats: 18 * 6 = 108\n\nStraws for hamsters: 50\n\nTotal: 108 + 50 = 158, which is still not 160.\n\nIf 7 rats per cage:\n\n3 * 7 = 21\n\n21 * 6 = 126\n\n126 + 50 = 176, which is over 160.\n\nSo there's no whole number of rats per cage that would make the total straws for small rodents 160. Therefore, the problem must have an error. However, since the user is asking for an answer, maybe I should proceed with the calculation even though it's not a whole number, or check if there's another interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the total straws given to all animals is 160, including the rabbits. Let's try that:\n\nTotal straws: 18x (rats) + 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 18x + 70 = 160\n\n18x = 90 => x = 5. That works. So maybe the original problem had a translation error, and the 160 includes the rabbits. If that's the case, then the answer is 5 rats per cage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to the small rodents is 160, and the rabbits are part of that. But that would be incorrect. However, if we proceed with that, then:\n\nTotal straws for small rodents (including rabbits): 160\n\nStraws for hamsters: 50\n\nStraws for rabbits: 20\n\nSo straws for rats: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90\n\nNumber of rats: 90 / 6 = 15\n\nNumber of rats per cage: 15 / 3 = 5\n\nThat would make sense. So maybe the problem had a translation error, and \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\" actually includes the rabbits, even though they are not rodents. That might be a possible mistake in the problem.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be 5 rats per cage. Since this is the only way to get a whole number, I think this is the intended solution, despite the possible translation error.\n</think>\n\nUm die Anzahl der Ratten pro Käfig zu bestimmen, analysieren wir die gegebenen Informationen:\n\n1. **Ratten**:  \n   - Es gibt **3 Käfige** mit gleich vielen Ratten.  \n   - Jede Ratte erhält **6 Strohhalme**.  \n   - Sei $ x $ die Anzahl der Ratten pro Käfig.  \n   - Gesamtzahl der Ratten: $ 3x $.  \n   - Gesamtstrohhalme für Ratten: $ 3x \\cdot 6 = 18x $.\n\n2. **Hamster**:  \n   - Es gibt **10 Käfige**, jeweils **1 Hamster** pro Käfig.  \n   - Jeder Hamster erhält **5 Strohhalme**.  \n   - Gesamtstrohhalme für Hamster: $ 10 \\cdot 5 = 50 $.\n\n3. **Hasen**:  \n   - **20 Strohhalme** werden an die Hasen verteilt.  \n   - Diese werden **nicht** in die Gesamtzahl der 160 Strohhalme für Nagetiere einbezogen.\n\n4. **Gesamtstrohhalme für Nagetiere (Ratten und Hamster)**:  \n   - $ 18x + 50 = 160 $.\n\n**Lösung der Gleichung**:  \n$$\n18x + 50 = 160 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 18x = 110 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{110}{18} \\approx 6.11\n$$\n\nDa die Anzahl der Ratten pro Käfig eine ganze Zahl sein muss, deutet dies auf einen Fehler in der Aufgabenstellung hin. **Wenn wir annehmen**, dass die **160 Strohhalme** auch die **Hasen** (20 Strohhalme) einschließen, ergibt sich:\n\n$$\n18x + 50 + 20 = 160 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 18x = 90 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 5\n$$\n\n**Antwort**:  \n$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$\n\n**Erklärung**:  \nDie korrekte Interpretation der Aufgabenstellung führt zu einer ganzen Zahl, wenn die 160 Strohhalme **alle Tiere** (Ratten, Hamster und Hasen) umfassen.

So, Russell is distributing straw to different animals in the pet store. The question is asking how many rats are in each cage. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, there are three cages for rats, and they're kept in equal-sized groups. Each rat gets 6 straws. Then there are 10 hamster cages, each hamster is alone, so each hamster gets 5 straws. There's also a rabbit hutch where 20 straws are given out. The total number of straws given to the small rodents is 160. We need to find out how many rats are in each cage.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"kleine Nagetiere\" which translates to small rodents. So, that would include the rats and the hamsters, right? The rabbits are probably not considered rodents here, so the 20 straws for the rabbits are separate. So the total straws given to the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. The rabbits are in their own hutch with 20 straws, which isn't part of the 160.\n\nSo, let's structure this:\n\nTotal straws for small rodents (rats and hamsters) = 160.\n\nRats are in 3 cages, each cage has the same number of rats. Let's call the number of rats per cage \"x\". Therefore, total rats = 3x. Each rat gets 6 straws, so total straws for rats = 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nHamsters: 10 cages, each with 1 hamster. So total hamsters = 10. Each hamster gets 5 straws, so total straws for hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nSo total straws for rats and hamsters is 18x + 50 = 160.\n\nTherefore, solving for x:\n\n18x + 50 = 160\n\nSubtract 50 from both sides:\n\n18x = 110\n\nThen x = 110 / 18\n\nWait, that gives a decimal. Hmm, 110 divided by 18 is approximately 6.111... But the number of rats should be a whole number. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nLet me check the problem again. The question says \"die Ratten werden in 3 Käfigen in gleich großen Gruppen gehalten\" which means the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal-sized groups. So each cage has the same number of rats. So total rats is 3 times the number per cage. Each rat gets 6 straws. Hamsters are 10 cages, each with 1 hamster, so 10 hamsters. Each hamster gets 5 straws. The total straws for small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. The rabbits have 20 straws, which are separate.\n\nSo the equation is 18x + 50 = 160. Then 18x = 110. Hmm, 110 divided by 18 is 6.111... That's not a whole number. That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says \"unter den Nagetieren\" which are the rodents, so the rabbits are not rodents. So the 160 straws are only for the rats and hamsters. The rabbits are separate. So the calculation should be correct. But getting a fractional number of rats doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a miscalculation.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nTotal straws for rats: 3 cages, each with x rats, so 3x rats. Each rat gets 6 straws: 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nTotal straws for hamsters: 10 hamsters, each gets 5 straws: 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nTotal straws for rodents: 18x + 50 = 160.\n\nSo 18x = 160 - 50 = 110.\n\nx = 110 / 18 = 5.555... Wait, that's still not a whole number. That's strange. Maybe the problem has a typo, or I misread something.\n\nWait, the problem says \"die Ratten werden in 3 Käfigen in gleich großen Gruppen gehalten\" – so the rats are in 3 cages, each with the same number of rats. So total rats is 3 times the number per cage. But maybe the problem is in German, and \"gleich großen Gruppen\" could mean that each group is the same size, but maybe the total number of rats is divided into 3 groups, each group being a cage. So that's the same as 3x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the total straws given to the small rodents is 160, which includes the rabbits? Wait, the problem says \"überall sonst im Laden wird kein Stroh verteilt\" – so only the rats, hamsters, and rabbits get straws. But the question says \"160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteilt wurden\" – so the 160 is only for the small rodents, which are rats and hamsters. The rabbits are in their own hutch with 20 straws, which are not part of the 160. So the equation should be correct.\n\nBut 110 divided by 18 is not a whole number. That suggests that either the problem has an error, or I have a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. The problem says:\n\n- Rats in 3 cages, equal groups. Each rat gets 6 straws.\n\n- 10 hamster cages, each with 1 hamster. Each hamster gets 5 straws.\n\n- 1 rabbit hutch with 20 straws.\n\nTotal straws for small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160.\n\nSo, total straws for rats: 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nTotal straws for hamsters: 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nTotal: 18x + 50 = 160.\n\nSo 18x = 110.\n\nx = 110 / 18 ≈ 6.111...\n\nHmm. That's not possible. Maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to all animals (including rabbits) is 160? Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe original question says: \"Wenn 160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteilt wurden, wie viele Ratten sind dann in jedem Käfig?\"\n\nSo \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\" – which would be among the small rodents. So that would be rats and hamsters. The rabbits are not rodents, so their 20 straws are separate. Therefore, the 160 is only for rats and hamsters. So the equation is correct.\n\nBut the answer is not a whole number. That's a problem. Maybe the problem has a typo. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated 160 - 50. 160 - 50 is 110. Yes. 18x = 110. So x = 110/18 = 5.555... That's not possible. Maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to all animals (including rabbits) is 160? Let's try that.\n\nIf total straws including rabbits is 160, then:\n\nStraws for rats: 18x\n\nStraws for hamsters: 50\n\nStraws for rabbits: 20\n\nTotal: 18x + 50 + 20 = 18x + 70 = 160\n\nThen 18x = 90\n\nx = 5\n\nThat would make sense.

Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed on a monthly interest rate of 2%. She pays after 3 months. I need to figure out how much she has to pay in total. Hmm, so this is about compound interest or simple interest? The question doesn't specify, but usually, when it's just monthly interest without mentioning compounding, it might be simple interest. But sometimes, in some contexts, it could be compounded. Wait, the problem says \"monatliche Zinsen in Höhe von 2%\", which translates to monthly interest of 2%. So maybe it's simple interest? Or is it compounded monthly?\n\nWait, in German, \"Zinsen\" can be either simple or compound, but if it's just stated as a monthly interest rate without specifying compounding, it might be simple interest. But I need to check. Let me think. If it's simple interest, the total interest would be principal * rate * time. So 100 * 0.02 * 3 = $6. So total amount would be 100 + 6 = $106. But if it's compound interest, then each month the interest is added to the principal. So first month: 100 * 1.02 = 102. Second month: 102 * 1.02 = 104.04. Third month: 104.04 * 1.02 = 106.1208.

Or compound?\n\nWait, the problem says \"monatliche Zinsen in Höhe von 2%\", which is \"monthly interest of 2%\". In some cases, if it's simple interest, the total interest would be 2% per month times the number of months. But if it's compound interest, it's 2% per month compounded monthly. However, in many cases, when you have a loan with monthly interest, it's often compounded. But maybe in this case, since it's just stated as monthly interest, it's simple interest. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the exact wording again. \"Sie einigten sich darauf, monatliche Zinsen in Höhe von 2 % zu haben.\" So they agreed on monthly interest of 2%. The term \"Zinsen\" here could be either. But in German financial contexts, if it's not specified, it might be simple interest. However, in practice, loans usually compound interest. But without more information, it's ambiguous. However, since the problem is likely from a math textbook or something, maybe it's expecting simple interest. But I need to check both possibilities.\n\nIf it's simple interest: 100 * 0.02 * 3 = 6, total 106.\n\nIf it's compound interest: 100*(1.02)^3 ≈ 106.12.\n\nBut the answer might depend on the convention. In some countries, for example, in Germany, if it's a loan with monthly interest, it's often compounded. But I'm not sure. However, since the problem doesn't specify compounding, maybe it's simple interest. But I need to think about standard problems. In many basic math problems, unless stated otherwise, simple interest is used. However, sometimes, if it's about loans, compound interest is more common. Hmm.\n\nWait, the question is in German, and maybe in the German education system, they might teach that if it's monthly interest, it's compounded. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a chapter that deals with simple interest, so the answer is 106. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given that the time is 3 months, and the interest is monthly, it's possible that it's compounded each month. So the answer would be 100*(1.02)^3.\n\nCalculating that: 1.02^3 = 1.061208, so 100*1.061208 = 106.1208, which is approximately $106.12. But maybe they want it rounded to the nearest cent, so $106.12. However, if it's simple interest, it's exactly $106. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, the problem says \"monatliche Zinsen in Höhe von 2 %\". The term \"Zinsen\" can be either simple or compound. But in German, if it's compound interest, it's usually specified as \"Zinseszins\" (compound interest). Since it's just \"Zinsen\", it might be simple interest. Therefore, the answer would be $106. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a context where compound interest is assumed.

Wait, but the user is asking for the answer, and the assistant's previous answer was 106.12. But maybe the correct answer is 106.12. Let me check with the formula for compound interest. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Here, P = 100, r = 2% per month, n = 1 (compounded monthly), t = 3 months. So A = 100*(1 + 0.02)^3 = 100*(1.02)^3 ≈ 106.12. So that's compound interest. But if it's simple interest, it's 100 + 100*0.02*3 = 106. So which is it?\n\nIn the absence of specific information, but given that the interest is monthly and the time is 3 months, it's more likely that the interest is compounded each month. Therefore, the answer is approximately $106.12. However, in some educational contexts, they might use simple interest.

I need to figure out how many sacks of wheat the trader sold. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the trader buys some sacks from a farmer at $20 per sack. Then, there's a transportation cost of $2 per sack to move them from the farm to the warehouse. After that, the trader sells all the sacks at $30 each and makes a total profit of $400. The question is asking how many sacks he sold.\n\nHmm, profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. So, I need to find the total revenue and total costs, set up the equation, and solve for the number of sacks.\n\nLet me denote the number of sacks as 'x'. \n\nTotal revenue would be the selling price per sack times the number of sacks. That's 30 dollars per sack times x, so 30x.\n\nNow, total costs. The trader has two types of costs: the cost of buying the sacks and the transportation cost. \n\nThe cost of buying the sacks is $20 per sack, so that's 20x. Then, transportation is $2 per sack, so that's another 2x. Therefore, total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.\n\nProfit is total revenue minus total cost. According to the problem, the profit is $400.

Let me write that down:\n\nTickets: $20.25\nFood: $20.25 - $4.50 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that. 20.25 minus 4.50. Hmm, 20.25 minus 4 is 16.25, and then minus another 0.50 is 15.75. So, the food cost is $15.75.\n\nNext, they took two different trains, each ride costing $33. Wait, the wording says \"2 verschiedene Bahnen, bei denen jede Fahrt 33 $ kostet.\" So, \"2 different trains, each ride costing 33 dollars.\" So, does that mean they took two rides, each costing $33? Or is it two different trains, each with a ride cost of $33? I think it's two rides, each costing $33. So total train cost is 2 * $33 = $66.\n\nSo, total costs are tickets + food + trains. Let me add those up.\n\nTickets: $20.25\nFood: $15.75\nTrains: $66.00\n\nTotal cost = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66.00. Let me compute that. 20.25 + 15.75 is 36.00, right? Because 20 + 15 is 35, and 0.25 + 0.75 is 1.00, so total 36.00. Then adding 66.00 gives 36 + 66 = 102.00. So total cost is $102.00.\n\nNow, they split the costs equally among three friends. So each person pays 102 divided by 3. Let me do that division. 102 ÷ 3 = 34. So each person pays $34.00.\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each part:\n\nTickets: 3 tickets for $20.25. That seems okay. Then food is $4.50 less than tickets, so 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75. Correct. Trains: 2 rides at $33 each, so 2*33=66. Correct. Total: 20.25 + 15.75 = 36, plus 66 is 102. Divided by 3 is 34. Yes, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"3 Eintritte\" which is 3 tickets, so that's correct. The food is 4.50 less than the tickets, so that's 15.75. Trains: 2 different trains, each ride 33. So two rides, each 33. So 66. Total 102. Divided by 3 is 34. So each pays 34 dollars. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just check once more. Maybe I miscalculated the food cost? 20.25 minus 4.50. Let's do it another way: 20.25 - 4.50. If I subtract 4.50 from 20.25, I can think of it as 20.25 - 4.00 = 16.25, then subtract 0.50 more: 16.25 - 0.50 = 15.75. Yes, that's correct. So food is 15.75. Then total is 20.25 + 15.75 = 36, plus 66 is 102. Divided by 3 is 34. Yep, that's right. So each friend pays $34.\n</think>\n\nDie drei Freunde teilen die Gesamtkosten gleichmäßig auf. \n\n1. **Eintrittskarten:**  \n   $20,25 für 3 Eintritte.\n\n2. **Essen:**  \n   $4,50 weniger als die Eintrittskarten:  \n   $20,25 - $4,50 = **$15,75**.\n\n3. **Bahntickets:**  \n   2 Fahrtkarten à $33:  \n   2 × $33 = **$66,00**.\n\n**Gesamtkosten:**  \n$20,25 (Eintritt) + $15,75 (Essen) + $66,00 (Bahnen) = **$102,00**.\n\n**Jeder Freund zahlt:**  \n$102,00 ÷ 3 = **$34,00**.\n\n**Antwort:** Jeder Freunde zahlte **34,00 $**."]], "filtered_resps": ["<think>\nOkay, let's see.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial number of trees is 50. Each year, he plants 10 and loses 2. So, the net gain per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees. But wait, does that mean each year the total number of trees increases by 8? Let me check that. If he starts with 50, then after one year, he adds 10 and subtracts 2, so 50 + 10 - 2 = 58. Then the next year, it would be 58 + 10 - 2 = 66, and so on. So yes, each year the number of trees increases by 8. So over 10 years, the total number of trees would be 50 + 8*10 = 50 + 80 = 130?

So first, calculate the number of trees after 10 years of planting and losing, then subtract 30% of that number.\n\nSo let's confirm the number of trees after 10 years. Starting with 50, each year adding 8. So after 1 year: 50 + 8 = 58. After 2 years: 58 + 8 = 66. Continuing this way, after 10 years, it would be 50 + 8*10 = 50 + 80 = 130. So 130 trees after 10 years. Then, 30% of these die. So 30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39. Therefore, the remaining trees would be 130 - 39 = 91. So the answer is 91?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the net gain is 8 per year. Let me check again. Each year, he plants 10 and loses 2. So the net change is +8 per year. So over 10 years, that's 10*8 = 80 added to the initial 50, giving 130. Then 30% die, so 70% remain. 130 * 0.7 = 91.

So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the 30% death was happening each year, the calculation would be different, but the problem states it's after 10 years. So I think the answer is 91. Let me just verify once more.\n\nStart with 50. Each year, +10 -2 = +8. After 10 years: 50 + 10*8 = 130. Then 30% die: 130 * 0.7 = 91. Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, does that mean she wants one of each color, or multiple crayons of each color? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"Sie braucht sie in 5 verschiedenen Farben.\" Translating that, it's \"She needs them in 5 different colors.\" So maybe she needs one crayon of each color, making it 5 crayons total.

The problem is about finding out how many children live in the city of Soda. The total population is given as 23,786 inhabitants. Out of these, there are 8,417 men and 9,092 women. The rest are children. So, I need to figure out how many children there are.\n\nFirst, I should check if the numbers for men and women add up to something less than the total population. If I add 8,417 and 9,092 together, that should give me the number of adults, and then subtracting that from the total population should give the number of children.\n\nLet me do the addition first. 8,417 plus 9,092. Let's break it down. 8,000 + 9,000 is 17,000. Then 417 + 92 is 509. So adding those together, 17,000 + 509 = 17,509. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 8,417 + 9,092. Maybe another way: 8,417 + 9,000 = 17,417, then add 92 more, which is 17,417 + 92 = 17,509. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo the total number of adults (men and women) is 17,509. Now, subtract that from the total population to find the number of children. The total population is 23,786. So 23,786 minus 17,509. Let me calculate that.\n\nStarting with 23,786 - 17,509. Let's subtract step by step. 23,786 minus 17,000 is 6,786. Then subtract 509 more. 6,786 - 500 = 6,286. Then subtract 9 more: 6,286 - 9 = 6,277. So the number of children should be 6,277.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. Maybe using another method. Let's write it down vertically:\n\n23,786\n-17,509\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n6 - 9. Can't do that, so borrow from the tens place. The tens digit is 8, so it becomes 7, and the units become 16. 16 - 9 = 7.\n\nNext, tens place: 7 - 0 = 7.\n\nHundreds place: 7 - 5 = 2.\n\nThousands place: 3 - 7. Again, can't do that, so borrow from the ten-thousands place. The ten-thousands digit is 2, so it becomes 1, and the thousands digit becomes 13. Then 13 - 7 = 6.\n\nTen-thousands place: 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nSo putting it all together: 6,277. That matches my previous result. So the number of children is 6,277.\n\nBut let me check once more with another approach. If I add the number of children (6,277) to the adults (17,509), it should equal the total population. 17,509 + 6,277. Let's add them:\n\n17,509 + 6,000 = 23,509\n23,509 + 277 = 23,786.

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Elaine hatte anfänglich 20 Pokemonkarten. Nach einem Monat hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt.\" So \"anfänglich\" means initially, so she had 20. Then, after one month, she had collected three times this number.

The phrase \"hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt\" – \"hatte\" is past tense, so \"she had collected three times this number.\" So if she had 20 initially, and then collected 60, her total would be 20 + 60 = 80.

This is a common ambiguity in such problems. Let me check similar problems. Usually, when it says \"she had triple the number,\" it refers to the total.

But the wording is \"gesammelt,\" which is \"collected,\" so maybe it's the amount she collected, not the total. So if she had 20 initially, and then collected 60, her total is 80. But the problem is in German, so maybe the translation is slightly different. Let me try to parse the German sentence again: \"Nach einem Monat hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt.\" \"Nach einem Monat\" – after one month, \"hatte sie\" – she had, \"das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt\" – collected three times this number. So \"dieser Zahl\" refers to the initial number, which is 20. So she collected 3*20=60 cards in the first month. Therefore, her total after the first month is 20 + 60 = 80. Then, in the second month, she collected 20 fewer than she did in the first month. So first month: 60, second month: 60 - 20 = 40. Then, in the third month, she collected double the number she collected in the first and second months combined. First and second months combined: 60 + 40 = 100. Double that is 200. So total cards collected over three months: 60 + 40 + 200 = 300. Then, adding the initial 20, total is 20 + 300 = 320. Wait, but if the first month's total was 80, then adding the second and third months? Wait, no. Wait, the initial 20 is separate. Then, each month she collects some cards. So total cards would be initial 20 plus the sum of the collected cards each month. So if first month she collected 60, second 40, third 200, total is 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320. But if the first month's total was 60 (meaning she collected 40), then the calculation would be different. Let me check again. If \"Nach einem Monat hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt,\" meaning that after one month, she had collected three times the initial number.

So total after second month: 80 + 40 = 120. Third month: double the amount collected in first and second months combined. First and second months combined: 60 + 40 = 100. Double that is 200. So total after third month: 120 + 200 = 320. So the answer would be 320. But if the first month's total was 60 (i.e., she collected 40), then first month: 20 + 40 = 60. Second month: 40 - 20 = 20.

So the problem is about Mark, who is an editor. He corrects the same number of sentences every week for two different publishers, A and B. Publisher B pays him double what Publisher A pays. He corrects a total of 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. The question is, how much does Mark earn in a week in cents?\n\nAlright, first, let me parse the information. He works for two publishers, A and B. Each week, he corrects the same number of sentences for both. Wait, the problem says \"die gleiche Anzahl Sätze für zwei verschiedene Herausgeber\" – so that translates to \"the same number of sentences for two different publishers.\" So, he corrects the same number of sentences for each publisher. So if he does, say, x sentences for A, he does x sentences for B as well. Therefore, total sentences per week is x + x = 2x. And that total is given as 1000 sentences. So 2x = 1000, which means x = 500. So he does 500 sentences for A and 500 for B.\n\nThen, the rates. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Publisher B pays double that. So double of 5 cents is 10 cents per sentence for B.\n\nSo his earnings would be: for A, 500 sentences * 5 cents each, and for B, 500 sentences * 10 cents each. Then add those two amounts together.\n\nLet me calculate that. For A: 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. For B: 500 * 10 = 5000 cents. Total is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents. So Mark earns 7500 cents per week.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"Herausgeber B bezahlt Mark das Doppelte dessen, was Herausgeber A bezahlt.\" So B pays double what A pays. Since A pays 5 cents, B pays 10 cents. That's correct. And since he does 500 sentences for each, that's 500*5 + 500*10. Yes, that's 2500 + 5000 = 7500. So 7500 cents. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The key points are:\n\n- Same number of sentences for both publishers. So 500 each.\n\n- Rates: A is 5 cents, B is double that, so 10 cents.\n\nTotal sentences: 1000. So 500 each. So calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the total sentences are split differently, but the problem says \"die gleiche Anzahl Sätze für zwei verschiedene Herausgeber\", which means the same number for each. So 500 each. So I think that's right.\n\nAnother way: Let me think if there's another interpretation. Suppose \"die gleiche Anzahl Sätze\" refers to the same number each week, but maybe not split equally between the two publishers? But no, the wording is \"für zwei verschiedene Herausgeber, die ihm jeweils eine andere Rate pro Satz bezahlen.\" So \"jeweils\" here would mean each publisher pays a different rate. But the number of sentences per publisher is the same each week. So he does the same number for each, so 500 each. So the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 7500 cents.\n</think>\n\nMark bearbeitet jede Woche 1000 Sätze, wobei er die gleiche Anzahl (500 Sätze) für beide Herausgeber A und B korrigiert.

The question is, how much did he earn in that year?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out his total earnings for the year. That should include his regular salary plus the one-time prize and the raise. Wait, but the raise is 5%, so does that apply to his entire salary for the year or just after the prize? Hmm, the problem says he received the prize on the first day of the year, so the raise would probably be effective immediately, right? So his weekly salary increases by 5% from that point on.\n\nLet me break it down. His original weekly salary is $2000. A 5% raise would be 2000 * 0.05 = $100. So his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100 per week. But wait, does the raise apply to all weeks of the year or just after the prize? Since he got the prize on the first day of the year, I think the raise is effective from that day, so for the entire year, he would be earning the increased salary. But wait, the prize is a one-time monetary reward, so that's separate from the raise. So the $5000 is a one-time bonus, and the 5% raise is a permanent increase in his salary.\n\nSo his total earnings would be the one-time bonus plus his salary for the year with the 5% raise. Let me confirm that. The problem says the prize consists of a one-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise. So the raise is in addition to the bonus. So he gets $5000 upfront and then his salary increases by 5% for the rest of the year.\n\nBut wait, does the raise apply to his entire salary for the year, including the weeks before the raise? No, because the raise is given on the first day of the year. So if the raise is effective immediately, then his entire salary for the year is at the increased rate. But maybe the raise is applied after the first week? Wait, the problem says he received the prize on the first day of the year. So the raise would be effective from that day, meaning his salary for the entire year is increased by 5%. Therefore, his weekly salary is $2000 * 1.05 = $2100 per week.\n\nBut then, the $5000 is a one-time payment. So total earnings would be $5000 plus (number of weeks in the year * $2100). Wait, but is the $5000 part of his salary or a separate bonus? The problem says the prize consists of both the $5000 and the 5% raise. So the $5000 is a one-time payment, and the 5% raise is a permanent increase. Therefore, his total earnings would be the $5000 plus his salary for the year with the 5% raise.\n\nBut wait, does the raise apply to his salary before or after the $5000? If the raise is part of the prize, then maybe the $5000 is separate from his salary. So his salary is increased by 5%, and he also gets $5000 as a bonus. So the total would be (original salary * 1.05 * number of weeks) + $5000.\n\nBut I need to check if the raise is applied to his original salary or if the $5000 is part of the salary. The problem states: \"Der Preis besteht in einer 1-maligen monetären Belohnung in Höhe von 5000 $ und einer Lohnerhöhung von 5 %.\" So the prize consists of a one-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise. So the raise is in addition to the $5000. Therefore, his salary is increased by 5%, and he also receives $5000 as a bonus.\n\nTherefore, his total earnings for the year would be:\n\n- The one-time bonus: $5000\n- His salary for the year with the 5% raise: (original weekly salary * 1.05) * number of weeks in the year\n\nAssuming a standard year has 52 weeks. So 52 weeks * $2000 * 1.05 + $5000.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of weeks. The problem says \"jede Woche des Jahres\" which is \"every week of the year.\" Depending on the year, it could be 52 or 53 weeks. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think we can assume 52 weeks.\n\nSo calculating:\n\nOriginal weekly salary: $2000\n\nAfter 5% raise: 2000 * 1.05 = $2100 per week\n\nTotal salary for the year: 2100 * 52 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 2100 * 52. Well, 2000*52 = 104,000 and 100*52=5,200. So total is 104,000 + 5,200 = 109,200.\n\nThen add the one-time bonus of $5000: 109,200 + 5,000 = 114,200.\n\nWait, but is the $5000 included in the salary or is it separate? The problem says the prize consists of both the $5000 and the raise. So the $5000 is a separate bonus, not part of his salary. Therefore, the total earnings would be the salary with the raise plus the $5000.\n\nBut another way to think: if the raise is part of the prize, maybe the $5000 is part of the salary? But the wording says \"monetäre Belohnung\" which is a monetary reward, so it's separate from the salary. So the answer should be 109,200 + 5,000 = 114,200.\n\nBut let me check again. If he received the prize on the first day of the year, does that mean the raise is effective from that day, so his entire salary for the year is at the increased rate, and the $5000 is a one-time payment. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the raise was given as part of the prize, maybe the $5000 is the total of the raise and the bonus? But the problem says the prize consists of both a one-time payment and a raise. So they are separate components.\n\nTherefore, the total earnings would be $5000 + (2000 * 1.05 * 52) = 5000 + 109,200 = 114,200.\n\nBut wait, another thought: if the raise is 5% of his salary, does that mean the $5000 is part of the salary? No, because the raise is a percentage increase on his salary, not a fixed amount. So the $5000 is a separate bonus. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be $114,200.\n</think>\n\nJohn verdiente im Jahr 2000 folgende Summe:\n\n1. **Lohnerhöhung**:  \n   Sein ursprünglicher Wochenlohn beträgt $2000.

So total is 104,000 + 5,200 = 109,200.\n\nThen add the one-time bonus of $5000: 109,200 + 5,000 = 114,200.\n\nWait, but is the $5000 included in the salary or is it separate? The problem says the prize consists of both the $5000 and the raise. So the $5000 is a separate bonus, not part of his salary. Therefore, the total earnings would be the salary with the raise plus the $5000.\n\nBut another way to think: if the raise is part of the prize, maybe the $5000 is part of the salary? But the wording says \"monetäre Belohnung\" which is a monetary reward, so it's separate from the salary. So the answer should be 109,200 + 5,000 = 114,200.\n\nBut let me check again. If he received the prize on the first day of the year, does that mean the raise is effective from that day, so his entire salary for the year is at the increased rate, and the $5000 is a one-time payment. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the raise was given as part of the prize, maybe the $5000 is the total of the raise and the bonus? But the problem says the prize consists of both a one-time payment and a raise. So they are separate components.\n\nTherefore, the total earnings would be $5000 + (2000 * 1.05 * 52) = 5000 + 109,200 = 114,200.\n\nBut wait, another thought: if the raise is 5% of his salary, does that mean the $5000 is part of the salary? No, because the raise is a percentage increase on his salary, not a fixed amount. So the $5000 is a separate bonus. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be $114,200.\n</think>\n\nJohn verdiente im Jahr 2000 folgende Summe:\n\n1. **Lohnerhöhung**:  \n   Sein ursprünglicher Wochenlohn beträgt $2000.

Brinley has taken five tests so far with scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. She's going to take a sixth test, and Mr. Bert allows her to drop the lowest score when calculating her average. She wants an average of 93. So, I need to figure out what she needs to score on the sixth test to achieve that average after dropping the lowest one.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which of her current five test scores is the lowest. Let me list them out: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86. The lowest here is 71, right? Because 71 is less than 86, 89, 92, and 100. So, she can drop that 71.\n\nNow, she has four tests left to consider for the average. Wait, no. Wait, she has six tests in total, but she can drop the lowest one. So, she has five tests already, and the sixth one is coming. So, when calculating the average, she can drop the lowest of all six tests. Wait, but the problem says \"jedes Semester, die niedrigste Punktzahl aus dem Durchschnitt zu streichen.\" So, does that mean she can drop the lowest score from the six tests, or from the five tests she's already taken?\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Er erlaubt den Studenten jedes Semester, die niedrigste Punktzahl aus dem Durchschnitt zu streichen.\" So, \"to drop the lowest score from the average.\" So, when calculating the average, they can drop the lowest score. So, if there are six tests, they can drop the lowest one, so the average is calculated over the remaining five.\n\nBut Brinley has already taken five tests, and is about to take the sixth. So, when she takes the sixth test, she will have six tests total. Then, she can drop the lowest one of those six. So, the question is, what score does she need on the sixth test so that when you drop the lowest of the six, the average of the remaining five is 93.\n\nSo, first, let's note her current five test scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86. The sixth test is unknown, let's call it x.\n\nSo, the six test scores are: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, x.\n\nShe can drop the lowest of these six. So, we need to figure out what x is such that when we drop the lowest score, the average of the remaining five is 93.\n\nBut here's the thing: depending on what x is, the lowest score might be different. For example, if x is lower than 71, then the lowest score would be x. If x is between 71 and 86, then the lowest is still 71. If x is between 86 and 89, the lowest is still 71. If x is between 89 and 92, same. If x is higher than 92, then the lowest is still 71. Wait, but 71 is already the lowest in the first five tests. So, unless x is lower than 71, the lowest score is 71. So, if x is less than 71, then the lowest is x. Otherwise, the lowest is 71.\n\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: x < 71. Then, the lowest score is x, so we drop x, and the average of the remaining five scores (89, 71, 92, 100, 86) is calculated. Wait, but if we drop x, then the remaining scores are the original five minus x? No, wait. Wait, the six tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, x. If x is the lowest, then we drop x, so the remaining five are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86. But that's the original five tests. Wait, but she already had those five tests. So, if x is the lowest, then the average would be (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86)/5. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, sum of the original five tests: 89 + 71 is 160, plus 92 is 252, plus 100 is 352, plus 86 is 438. So, 438 divided by 5 is 87.6. But she wants an average of 93. So, if x is the lowest, then the average is 87.6, which is less than 93. Therefore, in this case, even if she scores lower than 71, the average would be 87.6, which is not enough. Therefore, this case is not possible. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to 71, so that the lowest score is 71, which is dropped. Therefore, the remaining five scores are 89, 92, 100, 86, and x. Wait, no. Wait, if the lowest is 71, then we drop 71, so the five scores are 89, 92, 100, 86, and x. Wait, but x is the sixth test. So, if we drop the lowest (71), then the five scores are the other five: 89, 92, 100, 86, and x. Therefore, the average of these five is 93. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n(89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x)/5 = 93\n\nLet me compute the sum of the known scores: 89 + 92 is 181, plus 100 is 281, plus 86 is 367. So, 367 + x divided by 5 equals 93. Multiply both sides by 5: 367 + x = 465. Then, x = 465 - 367 = 98. So, x is 98. Therefore, she needs to score 98 on the sixth test.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that makes sense. If she scores 98, then her six tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, 98. The lowest is 71, so we drop that. The remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, 86, 98. Let's add those up: 89 + 92 = 181, +100 = 281, +86 = 367, +98 = 465. Divided by 5 is 93. Correct. So that works.\n\nBut wait, what if x is 71? Then, the scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, 71. The lowest is 71, so we drop one of them. So, the remaining five would be 89, 92, 100, 86, 71. Wait, but if you drop the lowest, which is 71, then you have to drop one instance of 71. So, the five scores would be 89, 92, 100, 86, and the other 71? Wait, no. Wait, if there are two 71s, then you can drop one of them. So, the remaining five would be 89, 92, 100, 86, and 71. Then, the average would be (89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 71)/5. Let's calculate that: 89 + 92 = 181, +100 = 281, +86 = 367, +71 = 438. Divided by 5 is 87.6, which is still less than 93. Therefore, even if she scores 71, the average is 87.6. Therefore, she needs to score higher than 71. Therefore, the previous calculation where x is 98 is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another scenario. Suppose x is higher than 71 but lower than 86. For example, if x is 85. Then, the scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, 85. The lowest is 71, so we drop that. The remaining five are 89, 92, 100, 86, 85. The average is (89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 85)/5. Let's compute that: 89 + 92 = 181, +100 = 281, +86 = 367, +85 = 452. Divided by 5 is 90.4, which is still less than 93. So, she needs a higher score.\n\nIf x is 98, as calculated, then the average is 93. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a case where x is the lowest, but even then, the average is not enough. But we saw that if x is the lowest, the average is 87.6, which is too low. Therefore, the only way to get the average up to 93 is to have x be high enough so that when you drop the original 71, the average of the other five (including x) is 93. Therefore, solving for x gives 98.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 98.\n</think>\n\nBrinley hat bereits fünf Testnoten: 89, 71, 92, 100 und 86.

Brinley has taken five tests so far with scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. She's going to take a sixth test, and Mr. Bert allows her to drop the lowest score when calculating her average. She wants an average of 93. So, I need to figure out what she needs to score on the sixth test to achieve that average after dropping the lowest one.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which of her current five test scores is the lowest. Let me list them out: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86. The lowest here is 71, right? Because 71 is less than 86, 89, 92, and 100. So, she can drop that 71.\n\nNow, she has four tests left to consider for the average. Wait, no. Wait, she has six tests in total, but she can drop the lowest one. So, she has five tests already, and the sixth one is coming. So, when calculating the average, she can drop the lowest of all six tests. Wait, but the problem says \"jedes Semester, die niedrigste Punktzahl aus dem Durchschnitt zu streichen.\" So, does that mean she can drop the lowest score from the six tests, or from the five tests she's already taken?\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Er erlaubt den Studenten jedes Semester, die niedrigste Punktzahl aus dem Durchschnitt zu streichen.\" So, \"to drop the lowest score from the average.\" So, when calculating the average, they can drop the lowest score. So, if there are six tests, they can drop the lowest one, so the average is calculated over the remaining five.\n\nBut Brinley has already taken five tests, and is about to take the sixth. So, when she takes the sixth test, she will have six tests total. Then, she can drop the lowest one of those six. So, the question is, what score does she need on the sixth test so that when you drop the lowest of the six, the average of the remaining five is 93.\n\nSo, first, let's note her current five test scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86. The sixth test is unknown, let's call it x.\n\nSo, the six test scores are: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, x.\n\nShe can drop the lowest of these six. So, we need to figure out what x is such that when we drop the lowest score, the average of the remaining five is 93.\n\nBut here's the thing: depending on what x is, the lowest score might be different. For example, if x is lower than 71, then the lowest score would be x. If x is between 71 and 86, then the lowest is still 71. If x is between 86 and 89, the lowest is still 71. If x is between 89 and 92, same. If x is higher than 92, then the lowest is still 71. Wait, but 71 is already the lowest in the first five tests. So, unless x is lower than 71, the lowest score is 71. So, if x is less than 71, then the lowest is x. Otherwise, the lowest is 71.\n\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: x < 71. Then, the lowest score is x, so we drop x, and the average of the remaining five scores (89, 71, 92, 100, 86) is calculated. Wait, but if we drop x, then the remaining scores are the original five minus x? No, wait. Wait, the six tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, x. If x is the lowest, then we drop x, so the remaining five are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86. But that's the original five tests. Wait, but she already had those five tests. So, if x is the lowest, then the average would be (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86)/5. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, sum of the original five tests: 89 + 71 is 160, plus 92 is 252, plus 100 is 352, plus 86 is 438. So, 438 divided by 5 is 87.6. But she wants an average of 93. So, if x is the lowest, then the average is 87.6, which is less than 93. Therefore, in this case, even if she scores lower than 71, the average would be 87.6, which is not enough. Therefore, this case is not possible. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to 71, so that the lowest score is 71, which is dropped. Therefore, the remaining five scores are 89, 92, 100, 86, and x. Wait, no. Wait, if the lowest is 71, then we drop 71, so the five scores are 89, 92, 100, 86, and x. Wait, but x is the sixth test. So, if we drop the lowest (71), then the five scores are the other five: 89, 92, 100, 86, and x. Therefore, the average of these five is 93. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n(89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x)/5 = 93\n\nLet me compute the sum of the known scores: 89 + 92 is 181, plus 100 is 281, plus 86 is 367. So, 367 + x divided by 5 equals 93. Multiply both sides by 5: 367 + x = 465. Then, x = 465 - 367 = 98. So, x is 98. Therefore, she needs to score 98 on the sixth test.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that makes sense. If she scores 98, then her six tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, 98. The lowest is 71, so we drop that. The remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, 86, 98. Let's add those up: 89 + 92 = 181, +100 = 281, +86 = 367, +98 = 465. Divided by 5 is 93. Correct. So that works.\n\nBut wait, what if x is 71? Then, the scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, 71.

I need to calculate the total distance for both periods and add them together.\n\nStarting with the first part: 5 times a week for 4 weeks. So, 5 rides per week multiplied by 4 weeks. That would be 5 * 4 = 20 rides. Each ride is 25 km, so 20 * 25 km. Let me calculate that. 20 * 25 is 500 km. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow the second part: 2 times a week for 3 weeks.

So the problem is about Joe's Halloween candy bag. There are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. And each chocolate bar is 40 grams. The question is asking for the total weight of Joe's candy bag in grams.\n\nAlright, first, I need to figure out the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as a candied apple, and the chocolate bar is 40 grams, then the candied apple must be half of that. Let me check that. If the chocolate bar is twice the weight of the apple, then apple weight = chocolate bar weight divided by 2. So 40 grams divided by 2 is 20 grams per candied apple. That makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total weight of all the chocolate bars and all the candied apples separately, then add them together for the total weight.\n\nStarting with the chocolate bars: there are 25 of them, each weighing 40 grams. So 25 multiplied by 40 grams. Let me do that calculation. 25 times 40... Well, 25 times 4 is 100, so 25 times 40 is 1000 grams. So the chocolate bars total 1000 grams.\n\nNext, the candied apples: there are 80 of them, each weighing 20 grams. So 80 multiplied by 20 grams. Hmm, 80 times 20. Let me think. 8 times 2 is 16, so 80 times 20 is 1600 grams. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 80 times 20. Let me break it down. 80 times 10 is 800, so 80 times 20 is 1600. Yeah, that's correct. So the candied apples total 1600 grams.\n\nNow, adding both totals together: 1000 grams (chocolates) plus 1600 grams (apples) equals 2600 grams. So the total weight of Joe's candy bag is 2600 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. For the chocolate bars: 25 times 40. 25 times 40. 25*40. 25*4=100, so 25*40=1000. That's correct. For the apples: 80*20. 80*20. 8*2=16, so 80*20=1600. Yes, that's right. Then 1000+1600=2600. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think that's all. The key steps were figuring out the weight of each candied apple by using the given ratio, then multiplying the number of each candy by their respective weights, and adding them up.

Since each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as a candied apple, and the chocolate bar is 40 grams, then the candied apple must be half of that. Let me check that. If the chocolate bar is twice the weight of the apple, then apple weight = chocolate bar weight divided by 2. So 40 grams divided by 2 is 20 grams per candied apple. That makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total weight of all the chocolate bars and all the candied apples separately, then add them together for the total weight.\n\nStarting with the chocolate bars: there are 25 of them, each weighing 40 grams. So 25 multiplied by 40 grams. Let me do that calculation. 25 times 40... Well, 25 times 4 is 100, so 25 times 40 is 1000 grams. So the chocolate bars total 1000 grams.\n\nNext, the candied apples: there are 80 of them, each weighing 20 grams. So 80 multiplied by 20 grams. Hmm, 80 times 20. Let me think. 8 times 2 is 16, so 80 times 20 is 1600 grams. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 80 times 20. Let me break it down. 80 times 10 is 800, so 80 times 20 is 1600. Yeah, that's correct. So the candied apples total 1600 grams.\n\nNow, adding both totals together: 1000 grams (chocolates) plus 1600 grams (apples) equals 2600 grams. So the total weight of Joe's candy bag is 2600 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. For the chocolate bars: 25 times 40. 25 times 40. 25*40. 25*4=100, so 25*40=1000. That's correct. For the apples: 80*20. 80*20. 8*2=16, so 80*20=1600. Yes, that's right. Then 1000+1600=2600. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think that's all. The key steps were figuring out the weight of each candied apple by using the given ratio, then multiplying the number of each candy by their respective weights, and adding them up. No steps seem to be missing here. The answer should be 2600 grams.\n</think>\n\nJoe's Süßigkeitentüte besteht aus 25 Schokoladenriegeln und 80 kandierte Äpfeln.

I need to figure out the total cost for buying each cup. The problem says that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost for half a dozen plates, each sold for $6000. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the units here. A dozen is 12, right? So twenty dozen cups would be 20 times 12. Let me calculate that: 20 * 12 = 240 cups. So, 240 cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates divided by 2, which is 3 plates. Wait, no, half a dozen is 6 divided by 2? Wait, no. A dozen is 12, so half a dozen is 6. Wait, the problem says \"ein halbes Duzend Teller\", which is half a dozen plates. So that's 6 plates. Each plate is sold for $6000. So the total cost for half a dozen plates would be 6 plates times $6000 each. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"die Gesamtkosten für ein halbes Duzend Teller, das jeweils zu 6000 $ verkauft wird.\" So \"jeweils\" means each, right? So each plate is sold for $6000. Therefore, half a dozen plates is 6 plates, each at $6000. So total cost for the plates would be 6 * 6000. Let me compute that: 6 * 6000 = 36,000 dollars.\n\nNow, the problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this total. So the cost of the cups is 36,000 minus 1,200. Let me calculate that: 36,000 - 1,200 = 34,800 dollars. So the total cost for twenty dozen cups is $34,800.\n\nBut the question is asking for the total cost for the purchase of each cup. Wait, does that mean the cost per cup or the total cost for all the cups? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original question again: \"Berechnen Sie die Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse.\" \"Gesamtkosten\" means total costs, and \"für den Kauf jeder Tasse\" would be \"for the purchase of each cup.\" Hmm, that might be a translation issue. If it's \"each cup,\" then it's the cost per cup. But \"Gesamtkosten\" is total costs, so maybe it's the total cost for all the cups? But the way it's phrased is confusing. Let me think.\n\nIf it's asking for the total cost for buying each cup, that might be the cost per cup. But maybe the original German is clearer. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the total cost for the purchase of all the cups, which would be the $34,800 we calculated. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Zwanzig Duzend Tassen kosten 1200 $ weniger als die Gesamtkosten für ein halbes Duzend Teller, das jeweils zu 6000 $ verkauft wird.\" So \"Zwanzig Duzend Tassen kosten...\" which is \"Twenty dozen cups cost...\" and then \"1200 $ weniger als die Gesamtkosten für ein halbes Duzend Teller...\" So the total cost for twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost for half a dozen plates. So we calculated the total cost for the plates as 6 * 6000 = 36,000, then subtract 1200 to get the total cost for the cups: 34,800. So if the question is asking for the total cost for the purchase of the cups, that would be 34,800. But the original question says \"die Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse.\" \"Jeder Tasse\" is \"each cup,\" so maybe it's the cost per cup. That would make more sense. Because if it's asking for the total cost for each cup, that would be the price per cup. So maybe I need to calculate the cost per cup.\n\nSo if twenty dozen cups cost 34,800 dollars, then how much is that per cup? Let's see. Twenty dozen is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. So total cost is 34,800 for 240 cups. Therefore, the cost per cup would be 34,800 divided by 240. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, divide 34,800 by 240. Let's simplify. 240 goes into 34,800 how many times? Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 3,480 / 24. Then divide numerator and denominator by 12: 3,480 ÷ 12 = 290, and 24 ÷ 12 = 2. So now it's 290 / 2 = 145. So 145 dollars per cup. Wait, that seems high, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, 240 cups for 34,800. Let's divide 34,800 by 240. 240 * 100 = 24,000. 34,800 - 24,000 = 10,800. 240 * 45 = 10,800. So 100 + 45 = 145. Yes, that's correct. So each cup costs $145. Therefore, the total cost for each cup is $145. But the question says \"Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse,\" which is \"total costs for the purchase of each cup.\" If \"each cup\" is singular, then it's the cost per cup, which is $145. If it's asking for the total cost for all the cups, it's $34,800. But given the wording, I think it's more likely asking for the cost per cup, which is $145. Let me check the original problem again to be sure.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Zwanzig Duzend Tassen kosten 1200 $ weniger als die Gesamtkosten für ein halbes Duzend Teller, das jeweils zu 6000 $ verkauft wird. Berechnen Sie die Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse.\"\n\nSo \"Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse\" – \"total costs for the purchase of each cup.\" The term \"Gesamtkosten\" is total costs, but \"jeder Tasse\" is each cup. So maybe it's the total cost for each cup, which would be the cost per cup. But \"Gesamtkosten\" is total, so maybe it's the total cost for all the cups. However, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. If it's asking for the total cost for each cup, that would be the price per cup. If it's asking for the total cost for the purchase of all the cups, that would be the total amount spent on the cups, which is $34,800. But given that the problem gives the price per plate and asks for the cost per cup, it's more likely that they want the cost per cup. Let me think again.\n\nIf the answer is $145 per cup, that seems reasonable. But let me check the calculation once more. Total cost for cups: 36,000 - 1,200 = 34,800. Number of cups: 20 dozen = 240. 34,800 divided by 240 is indeed 145. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be $145 per cup.

Sara wants to buy a new jacket and two pairs of shoes. The jacket is $30, and each pair of shoes is $20. So first, I need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants.

She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time. So that's 4 * 5 = $20 from babysitting. Then, she can also mow the lawn, and her parents pay her $4 each time she does that. The question is asking how many times she needs to mow the lawn to get the remaining money after babysitting.\n\nWait, but does she do both babysitting and mowing the lawn? The problem says she hütet die Nachbarskinder 4 Mal (which is babysitting) and earns $5 each time. Then, her parents pay her $4 each time she mäht den Rasen (mows the lawn). So she can do both activities. But the question is, how often does she need to mow the lawn in addition to the babysitting? Or is the babysitting already done, and she needs to mow the lawn on top of that?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Wenn Sara bereits 10 $ gespart hatte, bevor sie zu Hüten anfing...\" So she already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. Then she babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time. So that's 4*5 = $20. Then, she can also mow the lawn, which gives her $4 each time. So the total amount she can earn is from babysitting and mowing the lawn. But the question is, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to reach the total needed?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"wie oft muss sie dann den Rasen mähen, bevor sie sich die Jacke und die Schuhe leisten kann?\" So after she has already done the babysitting (4 times) and has the $10 saved, how many times does she need to mow the lawn?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if the babysitting is part of her earning or not. The problem says she hütet die Nachbarskinder 4 Mal and earns $5 each time. So that's part of her earnings. Then, she can also mow the lawn for $4 each time. So the total amount she can earn is from both activities. But the question is, how many times does she need to mow the lawn in addition to the babysitting?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"bevor sie zu Hüten anfing\" she had $10. Then, she starts babysitting 4 times, earning $20. Then, she can also mow the lawn. So the total money she has is $10 (initial) + $20 (from babysitting) + $4 * x (from mowing the lawn). She needs this total to be at least $70.\n\nSo let's set up the equation:\n\n10 (initial) + 4*5 (from babysitting) + 4*x (from mowing) ≥ 70\n\nCalculating that:\n\n10 + 20 + 4x ≥ 70\n\nSo 30 + 4x ≥ 70\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n4x ≥ 40\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nx ≥ 10\n\nSo she needs to mow the lawn 10 times.

Jerry has a flock of hens, some red and some white. The red hens lay 3 eggs per day, and the white ones lay 5 eggs per day. Every day, he collects 42 eggs. Also, he has two more white hens than red hens. The question is, how many red hens does he have?\n\nAlright, so I need to set up some equations here. Let me think. Let me denote the number of red hens as R. Then, since he has two more white hens than red ones, the number of white hens would be R + 2. That makes sense.\n\nNow, each red hen lays 3 eggs a day, so the total eggs from red hens would be 3 times R, which is 3R. Similarly, each white hen lays 5 eggs, so the total from white hens is 5 times (R + 2), which is 5(R + 2). The total eggs collected each day is 42, so adding those two together should equal 42.\n\nSo the equation would be: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42. Let me check that again. Yes, that seems right. Let me expand that equation.\n\nFirst, distribute the 5 into the parentheses: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42. Combine like terms: 3R + 5R is 8R, so 8R + 10 = 42. Then subtract 10 from both sides: 8R = 42 - 10, which is 32. Then divide both sides by 8: R = 32 / 8 = 4. So R is 4. Therefore, Jerry has 4 red hens.\n\nWait, let me verify that. If there are 4 red hens, then white hens are 4 + 2 = 6. The eggs from red hens would be 4 * 3 = 12 eggs. The eggs from white hens would be 6 * 5 = 30 eggs. Total eggs would be 12 + 30 = 42. Which matches the given total. So that checks out.\n\nHmm, seems straightforward. Did I miss anything? Let me think again. The problem says \"Hühnerschar\" which is a flock of hens. So hens are female chickens, right? So they lay eggs. The problem mentions \"roten Hennen\" and \"weißen Hennen\", so red hens and white hens. So the numbers are correct. The equations are set up properly. The answer seems to be 4 red hens. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: suppose R = 4, then white hens = 6. 4*3=12, 6*5=30. 12+30=42.

So, Jerry has two swimming pools, both with leaks losing 4 gallons per minute. The problem says that four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small one. Now, the big pool has four times as much as the small one. We need to find out how much water the small pool has now.\n\nHmm, let me start by defining variables. Let me think. Let's let the current amount of water in the small pool be S gallons. Then, the big pool would have 4S gallons now, since it's four times as much. But wait, that's now. But four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small one. So, I need to consider how much water has leaked out in those four minutes.\n\nBoth pools are losing water at 4 gallons per minute. So, in four minutes, each pool would have lost 4 minutes * 4 gallons/minute = 16 gallons. Wait, but is that correct? Wait, the leak rate is 4 gallons per minute for each pool, right? So each pool is losing 4 gallons every minute. Therefore, over four minutes, each pool would lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. So, if I consider the amount of water in each pool four minutes ago, it would be the current amount plus 16 gallons, because they've been losing water since then.\n\nWait, but if the current amount is S for the small pool, then four minutes ago, the small pool had S + 16 gallons. Similarly, the big pool now has 4S, so four minutes ago it had 4S + 16 gallons. But according to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small pool. So, that gives me an equation: 4S + 16 = 2*(S + 16). Let me check that.\n\nWait, hold on. If the pools are losing water, then the amount of water they have now is less than what they had four minutes ago. So, if I want to find out how much they had four minutes ago, I need to add the amount that has leaked out since then. So, yes, if now the small pool has S, then four minutes ago it had S + 4*4 = S + 16. Similarly, the big pool now has 4S, so four minutes ago it had 4S + 16. And that should be equal to twice the amount the small pool had four minutes ago, which is 2*(S + 16). So the equation is 4S + 16 = 2*(S + 16). Let me solve that.\n\nExpanding the right side: 2S + 32. So, 4S + 16 = 2S + 32. Subtract 2S from both sides: 2S + 16 = 32. Subtract 16: 2S = 16. Therefore, S = 8. So the small pool now has 8 gallons. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I did that correctly.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the small pool now has S gallons. Four minutes ago, it had S + 16 gallons. The big pool now has 4S gallons, so four minutes ago it had 4S + 16 gallons. And according to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small pool. So 4S + 16 = 2*(S + 16). Solving that gives 4S +16 = 2S +32, so 2S = 16, S=8. So the answer is 8 gallons. That seems right.\n\nBut let me verify with numbers. If the small pool now has 8 gallons, then four minutes ago it had 8 + 16 = 24 gallons. The big pool now has 4*8 = 32 gallons, so four minutes ago it had 32 + 16 = 48 gallons. And 48 is indeed twice 24. So that checks out. So the answer is 8 gallons. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: Let me define variables differently. Let me let the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago be x. Then, the big pool had 2x. Now, after four minutes, the small pool has x - 4*4 = x - 16 gallons. Similarly, the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons. According to the problem, now the big pool has four times the small pool. So 2x - 16 = 4*(x - 16). Let's solve that.\n\n2x -16 = 4x -64. Subtract 2x: -16 = 2x -64. Add 64: 48 = 2x. So x = 24. Therefore, the small pool now has x -16 = 24 -16 = 8 gallons. Same answer. So that's consistent. So that confirms it. So the answer is 8 gallons. Therefore, the small pool now has 8 gallons.\n\nI think that's correct. Both methods give the same result, and the check works. So I think the answer is 8 gallons.\n</think>\n\nJerry hat zwei Swimmingpools, die beide mit 4 Gallonen pro Minute leaken. Vor 4 Minuten hatte der große Pool doppelt so viel Wasser wie der kleine.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I did that correctly.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the small pool now has S gallons. Four minutes ago, it had S + 16 gallons. The big pool now has 4S gallons, so four minutes ago it had 4S + 16 gallons. And according to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small pool. So 4S + 16 = 2*(S + 16). Solving that gives 4S +16 = 2S +32, so 2S = 16, S=8. So the answer is 8 gallons. That seems right.\n\nBut let me verify with numbers. If the small pool now has 8 gallons, then four minutes ago it had 8 + 16 = 24 gallons. The big pool now has 4*8 = 32 gallons, so four minutes ago it had 32 + 16 = 48 gallons. And 48 is indeed twice 24. So that checks out. So the answer is 8 gallons. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: Let me define variables differently. Let me let the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago be x. Then, the big pool had 2x. Now, after four minutes, the small pool has x - 4*4 = x - 16 gallons. Similarly, the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons. According to the problem, now the big pool has four times the small pool. So 2x - 16 = 4*(x - 16). Let's solve that.\n\n2x -16 = 4x -64. Subtract 2x: -16 = 2x -64. Add 64: 48 = 2x. So x = 24. Therefore, the small pool now has x -16 = 24 -16 = 8 gallons. Same answer. So that's consistent. So that confirms it. So the answer is 8 gallons. Therefore, the small pool now has 8 gallons.\n\nI think that's correct. Both methods give the same result, and the check works. So I think the answer is 8 gallons.\n</think>\n\nJerry hat zwei Swimmingpools, die beide mit 4 Gallonen pro Minute leaken. Vor 4 Minuten hatte der große Pool doppelt so viel Wasser wie der kleine.

I need to find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years. Right now, Harriet is 21 years old. The problem says Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, and Harriet is half as old as Zack. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note down what we know. Harriet's current age is 21. So, Harriet = 21. Now, Adrian is three times as old as Harriet. That means Adrian's current age is 3 * Harriet's age. Let me calculate that: 3 * 21 = 63. So Adrian is 63 years old now.\n\nNext, Harriet is half as old as Zack. Wait, if Harriet is half as old as Zack, that means Zack is twice as old as Harriet. So Zack's current age would be 2 * Harriet's age. Let me check that. If Harriet is 21, then Zack is 2 * 21 = 42. So Zack is 42 years old now.\n\nNow, the question asks for the average age of the three in three years. So I need to find their ages in three years and then compute the average.\n\nLet's calculate each person's age in three years. For Harriet: she is currently 21, so in three years she'll be 21 + 3 = 24. Adrian is currently 63, so in three years he'll be 63 + 3 = 66. Zack is currently 42, so in three years he'll be 42 + 3 = 45.\n\nNow, to find the average age, I need to add up their ages in three years and divide by 3. Let's add them up: 24 (Harriet) + 66 (Adrian) + 45 (Zack) = 24 + 66 is 90, and 90 + 45 is 135. Then divide by 3: 135 / 3 = 45. So the average age in three years is 45.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24. Adrian: 3*21=63, plus 3 is 66. Zack: 2*21=42, plus 3 is 45. Sum: 24 + 66 = 90, 90 + 45 = 135. 135 divided by 3 is indeed 45. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: maybe I can calculate the current average and then add 3 years to each person's age. The current average age would be (21 + 63 + 42)/3. Let's see: 21 + 63 = 84, 84 + 42 = 126. 126 / 3 = 42. Then, in three years, each person's age increases by 3, so the average would increase by 3 as well. So 42 + 3 = 45. That matches my previous result. So that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the average age in three years is 45. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nHarriet ist derzeit 21 Jahre alt. \n\n- **Adrians Alter**: 3 × Harriets Alter = 3 × 21 = **63 Jahre**.\n- **Zacks Alter**: 2 × Harriets Alter = 2 × 21 = **42 Jahre**.\n\nIn drei Jahren:\n- Harriet: 21 + 3 = **24 Jahre**.\n- Adrian: 63 + 3 = **66 Jahre**.\n- Zack: 42 + 3 = **45 Jahre**.\n\n**Durchschnittsalter in drei Jahren**:\n$$\n\\frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \\frac{135}{3} = \\boxed{45}\n$$\n\n**Antwort:** Das Durchschnittsalter der drei in drei Jahren beträgt **45 Jahre**."]], "filtered_resps": ["<think>\nOkay, let's see.

For Harriet: she is currently 21, so in three years she'll be 21 + 3 = 24. Adrian is currently 63, so in three years he'll be 63 + 3 = 66. Zack is currently 42, so in three years he'll be 42 + 3 = 45.\n\nNow, to find the average age, I need to add up their ages in three years and divide by 3. Let's add them up: 24 (Harriet) + 66 (Adrian) + 45 (Zack) = 24 + 66 is 90, and 90 + 45 is 135. Then divide by 3: 135 / 3 = 45. So the average age in three years is 45.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24. Adrian: 3*21=63, plus 3 is 66. Zack: 2*21=42, plus 3 is 45. Sum: 24 + 66 = 90, 90 + 45 = 135. 135 divided by 3 is indeed 45. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: maybe I can calculate the current average and then add 3 years to each person's age. The current average age would be (21 + 63 + 42)/3. Let's see: 21 + 63 = 84, 84 + 42 = 126. 126 / 3 = 42. Then, in three years, each person's age increases by 3, so the average would increase by 3 as well. So 42 + 3 = 45. That matches my previous result. So that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the average age in three years is 45. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nHarriet ist derzeit 21 Jahre alt. \n\n- **Adrians Alter**: 3 × Harriets Alter = 3 × 21 = **63 Jahre**.\n- **Zacks Alter**: 2 × Harriets Alter = 2 × 21 = **42 Jahre**.\n\nIn drei Jahren:\n- Harriet: 21 + 3 = **24 Jahre**.\n- Adrian: 63 + 3 = **66 Jahre**.\n- Zack: 42 + 3 = **45 Jahre**.\n\n**Durchschnittsalter in drei Jahren**:\n$$\n\\frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \\frac{135}{3} = \\boxed{45}\n$$\n\n**Antwort:** Das Durchschnittsalter der drei in drei Jahren beträgt **45 Jahre**."], "doc_hash": "830a75d0adb27e5e8ba63cb334fdbd602b1aa7bab2861cd4fb53013081dfaafc", "prompt_hash": "8f3db5129c199f07cca530bd0a137916c213d23a1c4f18fadfa8305e10255b9d", "target_hash": "811786ad1ae74adfdd20dd0372abaaebc6246e343aebd01da0bfc4c02bf0106c", "exact_match": 0.0}

There are four students: Naomi, Yuri, Brianna, and Jojo. Together they scored 251 points in a board game. I need to find out how many points Jojo scored. \n\nFirst, let me note down the information given:\n\n- Total points: 251\n- Naomi's points: 68\n- Yuri's points: 10 more than half of Naomi's points\n- Brianna's points: 17 more than Naomi's points\n\nSo, the problem is asking for Jojo's points. Since the total is the sum of all four students' points, if I can find the points of the other three, I can subtract their total from 251 to get Jojo's score.\n\nLet me start by calculating Yuri's points. The problem says Yuri scored 10 points more than half of what Naomi scored. Naomi scored 68, so half of that is 68 divided by 2. Let me compute that: 68 / 2 = 34. Then, adding 10 points to that gives Yuri's score: 34 + 10 = 44. So Yuri has 44 points.\n\nNext, Brianna's points. She scored 17 more than Naomi. Naomi has 68, so Brianna's points are 68 + 17. Let me add that: 68 + 17 = 85. So Brianna has 85 points.\n\nNow, let's sum up the points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. That would be 68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna). Let me add those numbers step by step. \n\nFirst, 68 + 44. 60 + 40 is 100, and 8 + 4 is 12, so total is 112. Then, adding 85 to that: 112 + 85. Breaking it down: 100 + 80 = 180, 12 + 5 = 17, so total is 180 + 17 = 197. \n\nSo the three students have a combined total of 197 points. The total for all four is 251, so Jojo's points would be 251 - 197. Let me compute that. 251 - 197. Hmm, 251 - 200 would be 51, but since it's 197, which is 3 less than 200, I need to add 3 back. So 51 + 3 = 54. Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.\n\nWait, let me check that subtraction again to be sure. 251 minus 197. Let's do it another way: 197 + 54 = 251? Let's see: 197 + 50 = 247, then +4 = 251. Yes, that's correct. So Jojo has 54 points.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Naomi: 68\n- Yuri: 44\n- Brianna: 85\n- Jojo: ?\n\nTotal of the three: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The original German is \"90 Geranien und 40 Petunien weniger als Geranien.\" So \"40 Petunien weniger als Geranien\" – that would mean 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So yes, petunias = geraniums - 40. So 90 geraniums, 50 petunias. Total is 140. That seems straightforward. I don't see any other interpretation. Maybe someone could think that he plants 90 geraniums and 40 petunias, and then less than geraniums, but that would be unclear. But the way it's phrased, \"90 Geranien und 40 Petunien weniger als Geranien\" – the \"und\" connects the two parts: 90 geraniums and (40 petunias less than geraniums). So yeah, the answer should be 140.\n</think>\n\nAndy pflanzt **90 Geranien** und **40 Petunien weniger als Geranien**. \n\n- **Petunien**: $ 90 - 40 = 50 $\n- **Gesamtzahl der Blumen**: $ 90 + 50 = 140 $\n\n**Antwort:** Andy pflanzt insgesamt **140 Blumen**."], "doc_hash": "3fdc4d5189366b9d38ed7e895e710cbdf39b79aafacf54cfe1094b8fe862bedc", "prompt_hash": "15e080fe9697a9b97f846b5984caf59c63465264a56f942a08cc5956c355fb5a", "target_hash": "dbae772db29058a88f9bd830e957c695347c41b6162a7eb9a9ea13def34be56b", "exact_match": 0.0}

James has some Pokémon cards, and I need to figure out the probability that a randomly drawn card is a Water-type after he moves some and buys more. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial counts: 30 Fire, 20 Grass, and 40 Water. So total cards at the beginning would be 30 + 20 + 40. Let me add that up. 30 + 20 is 50, plus 40 is 90. So he starts with 90 cards.\n\nNow, he moves 8 Water-type cards. Moving them... does that mean he removes them from his collection? I think so. So the Water-type cards go down by 8. So 40 - 8 = 32 Water-type cards left.\n\nThen he buys 14 Grass-type cards. So Grass-type increases by 14. Original Grass was 20, so 20 + 14 = 34 Grass-type cards.\n\nSo now, the new counts are: Fire remains 30, Grass is 34, and Water is 32. Let me check that again. Yes, he only changed Water and Grass. Fire stays the same.\n\nNow, the total number of cards after these changes. Let's calculate that. Fire (30) + Grass (34) + Water (32). 30 + 34 is 64, plus 32 is 96. So total cards now are 96.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that a randomly drawn card is Water-type. So that would be the number of Water-type cards divided by the total number of cards, then converted to a percentage.\n\nSo, 32 Water-type out of 96 total. Let me compute that fraction. 32 divided by 96. Hmm, simplifying that. Both numbers are divisible by 32? 32 ÷ 32 is 1, 96 ÷ 32 is 3. So 1/3. Wait, 1 divided by 3 is approximately 0.3333... So as a percentage, that's 33.333...%.\n\nBut the question says to round to the nearest whole number. So 33.333...% rounds to 33%. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal counts: 30 Fire, 20 Grass, 40 Water. Total 90. Then he moves 8 Water, so 40 - 8 = 32. Then buys 14 Grass, so 20 +14=34. So new total is 30 +34 +32 = 96. Correct. Then 32/96 = 1/3 ≈ 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest whole number is 33%. But wait, sometimes when you round, if it's exactly .5, you round up. But here it's .333..., which is less than .5, so it should round down to 33%.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Maybe I miscalculated the total? Let me add 30 + 34 + 32 again. 30 + 34 is 64, 64 +32 is 96. Yes. 32 divided by 96. Let me do the division again. 32 ÷ 96. Well, 96 divided by 3 is 32, so 32 is 1/3 of 96. So 1/3 is approximately 33.333...%. So yes, 33.33%, which rounds to 33%.\n\nWait, but sometimes in probability questions, they might expect you to use decimal places or something else. But the question says to round to the nearest whole number, so 33.33% is definitely 33% when rounded. So the answer should be 33%.\n\nBut let me check once more if I interpreted the problem correctly. He \"verlegt\" 8 Water-type cards. \"Verlegen\" in German can mean moving them somewhere else, but in the context of counting cards, does that mean removing them from his collection? If he moves them to another pile or gives them away, then yes, they are no longer in his collection. So the count decreases by 8. Then he buys 14 Grass-type, so that's adding to his collection. So the total number of cards is original 90 minus 8 (moved) plus 14 (bought). So 90 -8 +14 = 96. Which matches my previous total. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 32/96 = 1/3 ≈ 33.33%, which rounds to 33%.

Then buys 14 Grass, so 20 +14=34. So new total is 30 +34 +32 = 96. Correct. Then 32/96 = 1/3 ≈ 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest whole number is 33%. But wait, sometimes when you round, if it's exactly .5, you round up. But here it's .333..., which is less than .5, so it should round down to 33%.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Maybe I miscalculated the total? Let me add 30 + 34 + 32 again. 30 + 34 is 64, 64 +32 is 96. Yes. 32 divided by 96. Let me do the division again. 32 ÷ 96. Well, 96 divided by 3 is 32, so 32 is 1/3 of 96. So 1/3 is approximately 33.333...%. So yes, 33.33%, which rounds to 33%.\n\nWait, but sometimes in probability questions, they might expect you to use decimal places or something else. But the question says to round to the nearest whole number, so 33.33% is definitely 33% when rounded. So the answer should be 33%.\n\nBut let me check once more if I interpreted the problem correctly. He \"verlegt\" 8 Water-type cards. \"Verlegen\" in German can mean moving them somewhere else, but in the context of counting cards, does that mean removing them from his collection? If he moves them to another pile or gives them away, then yes, they are no longer in his collection. So the count decreases by 8. Then he buys 14 Grass-type, so that's adding to his collection. So the total number of cards is original 90 minus 8 (moved) plus 14 (bought). So 90 -8 +14 = 96. Which matches my previous total. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 32/96 = 1/3 ≈ 33.33%, which rounds to 33%. So the answer is 33%.\n</think>\n\nJames beginnt mit 30 Feuer-, 20 Pflanzen- und 40 Wasserartigen Karten, was insgesamt **90 Karten** ergibt. \n\n- **Verlegte Wasserartige**: 8 Wasserartige werden verlegt, sodass nur noch $40 - 8 = 32$ Wasserartige übrig bleiben.  \n- **Gekaufte Pflanzenartige**: 14 Pflanzenartige werden gekauft, sodass $20 + 14 = 34$ Pflanzenartige vorhanden sind.  \n\nDie neue Gesamtanzahl der Karten beträgt:  \n$$\n30 \\ (\\text{Feuer}) + 34 \\ (\\text{Pflanzen}) + 32 \\ (\\text{Wasser}) = 96 \\ \\text{Karten}.\n$$\n\nDie Wahrscheinlichkeit, eine Wasserartige Karte zu ziehen, ist:  \n$$\n\\frac{32}{96} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 33{,}33\\%.\n$$\n\n**Gerundet auf die nächste ganze Zahl**: **33%**.\n\n**Antwort:** 33%"], "doc_hash": "21e659a24cb16511e46272446d90f5e59b3a65bd9a9da4541f3232e06d44f7ae", "prompt_hash": "ccd697cd96ea76066c7f363a4f5dfb2b2562424fb2c259e3ff2777921c5fcecc", "target_hash": "c6f3ac57944a531490cd39902d0f777715fd005efac9a30622d5f5205e7f6894", "exact_match": 0.0}

So there's this watermelon farm that produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went after two months and found that 30% were ripe, so she took those home. Then two weeks later, she came back and found that 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe, so she harvested those. The question is asking how many watermelons were not ripe after the two weeks.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, the total number of watermelons is 120. When Ashlyn first visits, 30% are ripe. So I need to calculate 30% of 120. Let me do that. 30% is 0.3 in decimal, so 0.3 times 120. Let me compute that: 0.3 * 120 = 36. So she took 36 watermelons home. That means the remaining watermelons after her first visit would be 120 - 36 = 84. Got that.\n\nNow, two weeks later, she comes back and finds that 3/4 of the remaining watermelons are ripe. The remaining watermelons at that point are 84. So 3/4 of 84 are ripe. Let me calculate that. 3/4 of 84 is (3/4)*84. Let me compute that. 84 divided by 4 is 21, and 21 times 3 is 63. So 63 watermelons were ripe at that time, and she harvested those. \n\nThe question is asking how many were not ripe after the two weeks. So after the second harvest, the number of unripe watermelons would be the remaining watermelons after the second harvest. Wait, but let me make sure. The problem says that when she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining were ripe, so she harvested those. Therefore, the ones that were not ripe would be the remaining 1/4 of the 84. Because if 3/4 were ripe, then 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 were not ripe. So 1/4 of 84 is 21. Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ripe after the two weeks.\n\nWait, but let me check again. First, initial total is 120. First harvest: 30% of 120 is 36, so 120 - 36 = 84 left. Then, two weeks later, 3/4 of 84 are ripe, so 3/4 * 84 = 63 harvested. Therefore, the remaining unripe would be 84 - 63 = 21. Yes, that's the same as 1/4 of 84. So 21 is the answer. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. The question says \"wie viele Melonen waren nach den zwei Wochen nicht reif, um geerntet zu werden?\" So after the two weeks, when she came back, she harvested the 3/4 that were ripe, so the ones that were not ripe would be the remaining 1/4. So yes, 21. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking about after both harvests? But no, the question specifically says \"nach den zwei Wochen\" which is after the two weeks, so after the second harvest. So the answer is 21. \n\nI think that's correct.

So his friend must eat 3 per day, right? Because 6 divided by 2 is 3. But actually, the problem says Steve eats twice as many as his friend, so Steve's amount is double his friend's.

The problem says Steve eats twice as many as his friend, but the question is only about Steve's own consumption. So maybe the friend's part is just extra info, but the key is Steve's 6 per day.

Steve wants to start eating more tomatoes and is growing his own cherry tomatoes. The question is asking how many plants he needs. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, Steve eats twice as many tomatoes as his friend. And he eats 6 per day. Wait, so if he eats 6 a day, that's twice his friend's amount. So his friend must eat 3 per day, right? Because 6 divided by 2 is 3. But actually, the problem says Steve eats twice as many as his friend, so Steve's amount is double his friend's. So if Steve eats 6, then his friend eats 3. But maybe the question is only about Steve's consumption? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem states: \"Er isst doppelt so viele wie seine Freundin. Er isst 6 pro Tag.\" So Steve eats 6 per day, which is double his friend's amount. So his friend eats 3 per day. But the question is about how many plants Steve needs. So maybe we need to calculate Steve's total consumption and then figure out how many plants are needed to supply that.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"ein Stock 3 Tomaten pro Woche erzeugen kann.\" So each plant produces 3 tomatoes per week. So we need to find out how many plants are needed to produce the number of tomatoes Steve eats in a week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week. He eats 6 per day, so 6 * 7 days = 42 tomatoes per week.\n\nEach plant produces 3 tomatoes per week. So to get 42 tomatoes, he needs 42 / 3 = 14 plants. So the answer would be 14?\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if there's any other information I missed. The part about his friend's consumption—does that affect anything? The problem says Steve eats twice as many as his friend, but the question is only about Steve's own consumption. So maybe the friend's part is just extra info, but the key is Steve's 6 per day. So yes, 6 per day, 42 per week, divided by 3 per plant per week gives 14 plants. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me make sure. The problem says \"wie viele Stöcke braucht er dann?\" So \"how many plants does he need then?\" So yes, based on his own consumption. The friend's part is just context, but not necessary for the calculation. So the answer is 14.\n</think>\n\nSteve isst 6 Tomaten pro Tag, also 6 × 7 = **42 Tomaten pro Woche**.

So the problem is about Ram who buys 25 pens. He can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. The question is, how many pens can he have in total when the ink runs out?\n\nHmm, okay. So first, he starts with 25 pens. When he uses them, they become empty. Then he can collect the ink from those empty pens to make new ones. The key here is that every five empty pens can be turned into one new pen. But then, when he makes that new pen, he can use it again, which would eventually become empty again, right? So there's a cycle here.\n\nLet me think step by step. First, he uses the 25 pens. So he uses all 25, which leaves him with 25 empty pens. Then he can make new pens by mixing the ink. Since five empty pens make one new pen, he can make 25 divided by 5, which is 5 new pens. So now he has 5 pens. Then he uses those 5 pens, which gives him 5 more empty pens. Then he can make 5 divided by 5, which is 1 new pen. Now he has 1 pen. He uses that, which gives him 1 empty pen. But he can't make another pen because he needs five empty pens. So that's it?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to collect the empty pens from the new ones he makes. Let me check again.\n\nStart with 25 pens. Use them all, get 25 empty pens. Make 25/5 = 5 new pens. Now he has 5 pens. Use those 5, get 5 empty pens. Make 5/5 = 1 new pen. Now he has 1 pen. Use that, get 1 empty pen. Now he has 1 empty pen, which isn't enough to make another. So total pens used would be 25 + 5 + 1 = 31? Wait, but the question is asking how many pens he can have in total when the ink runs out. So maybe the total number of pens he can have is the original 25 plus the ones he made from recycling?\n\nWait, but when he uses the pens, they become empty, but the new pens he makes are added to his total. So the total number of pens he can have is the original 25 plus the ones he made from recycling. But when he uses the recycled pens, they also become empty, so he can make more. So the total number of pens he can have is the sum of all the pens he made through the process.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"wie viele Stifte kann er dann insgesamt haben?\" which translates to \"how many pens can he have in total when the ink runs out?\" So maybe it's the total number of pens he can use, including the ones he made from recycling. Let me think again.\n\nFirst, he buys 25 pens. He uses them all, so he has 25 empty pens. Then he makes 5 new pens. Now he has 5 pens. He uses those 5, so now he has 5 empty pens. Then he makes 1 new pen. He uses that 1, so he has 1 empty pen. So total pens used: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. But the total number of pens he has is 25 original plus 5 + 1 = 31. But when the ink runs out, he can't make any more. So the answer is 31?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to collect the empty pens from the new ones. Let me check again. Let's track the number of empty pens he has after each step.\n\nStart with 25 pens. He uses them all, so he has 25 empty pens. Then he makes 5 new pens. So he uses 25 empty pens to make 5 new ones. Now he has 5 pens. He uses those 5, so he has 5 empty pens. Then he makes 1 new pen. Now he has 1 pen. He uses that, so he has 1 empty pen. Now he can't make any more. So total pens he has used: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. But the total number of pens he has is 25 original plus 5 + 1 = 31. So the answer is 31?\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is using the formula for such problems. It's similar to the classic problem where you have bottles and you can exchange empty bottles for new ones. The formula is usually total = initial + floor(initial / (n-1)), where n is the number needed to exchange. Wait, but maybe not exactly. Let me recall.\n\nIn the classic problem, if you have 10 bottles and you can exchange 3 empty bottles for 1 new one, how many can you drink? The answer is 14: 10 + 3 + 1 = 14. Because after drinking 10, you have 10 empties. Exchange 9 for 3 new, drink them, now you have 3 empties + 1 left from the initial 10, so 4. Exchange 3 for 1, drink it, now you have 1 + 1 = 2 empties. So total is 10 + 3 + 1 = 14.\n\nBut in this case, the exchange rate is 5 empties for 1 new. So starting with 25 pens. Let's apply the same logic.\n\nFirst, 25 pens used, 25 empties. Exchange 25 / 5 = 5 new pens. Now, 5 pens used, 5 empties. Exchange 5 / 5 = 1 new pen. Now, 1 pen used, 1 empty. Can't exchange. Total pens used: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. So same as before.\n\nBut in the classic problem, the formula is total = initial + floor(initial / (n-1)). Wait, but here n is 5. So 25 + floor(25 / (5-1))? Wait, 25 / 4 is 6.25, floor is 6. But that would be 25 + 6 = 31. Which matches. So maybe the formula is total = initial + floor(initial / (n-1)). But why?\n\nWait, the formula for the classic problem where you can exchange k empties for 1 new. The total number of drinks is initial + floor( (initial - 1) / (k - 1) ). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me check with the example. If you have 10 bottles, exchange 3 for 1. Then total is 10 + 3 + 1 = 14. Which is 10 + floor(10 / 2) = 10 + 5 = 15? No, that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is total = initial + floor( (initial - 1) / (k - 1) ). For the 10 bottles, k=3: (10-1)/(3-1) = 9/2 = 4.5, floor is 4. So total is 10 + 4 = 14. Which matches. So in this case, with initial=25, k=5: (25-1)/(5-1) = 24/4 = 6. So total is 25 + 6 = 31. Which matches our previous result. So that seems to be the formula.\n\nSo applying that formula here, the answer is 31. Therefore, the total number of pens he can have is 31.\n\nBut let me verify again with the step-by-step process:\n\nStart with 25 pens. Use them all, 25 empties. Exchange 25 / 5 = 5 new pens. Now, 5 pens used, 5 empties. Exchange 5 / 5 = 1 new pen. Now, 1 pen used, 1 empty. Total pens used: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. So yes, that's 31.\n\nBut wait, when he exchanges the 25 empties for 5 new pens, he uses up 25 empties to get 5 new. Then he uses those 5, which gives 5 empties. Then exchanges those 5 for 1 new. Uses that 1, gives 1 empty. So total empties after all is 1. So the total number of pens he has is 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 31.\n</think>\n\nRam beginnt mit 25 Stiften. Jede dieser Stifte wird verwendet und wird zu einem leeren Stift.

The question is about Dolly and Pandora and how many books they will read in total if they both read each other's books and their own. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. So initially, Dolly has 2, Pandora has 1. Now, the problem says they both read the books from each other and their own. Wait, does that mean each of them reads the other's books plus their own? Or does it mean they exchange books and then read all of them?\n\nLet me parse the sentence again: \"Wenn Dolly und Pandora beide die Bücher voneinander und ihre eigenen lesen...\" So \"both read the books from each other and their own.\" So each of them reads the other's books and their own. So Dolly reads Pandora's books (which is 1) plus her own (2). Pandora reads Dolly's books (2) plus her own (1). So total books read by both would be Dolly's total plus Pandora's total.\n\nBut wait, does that count duplicates? Like, if they both read the same books, are we supposed to count each instance or just the unique books? The question says \"wie viele Bücher werden sie dann insgesamt lesen?\" which translates to \"how many books will they read in total?\" So maybe it's the total number of books read by both, counting each person's reading separately. So Dolly reads 1 (Pandora's) + 2 (her own) = 3 books. Pandora reads 2 (Dolly's) + 1 (her own) = 3 books. So total is 3 + 3 = 6 books. But wait, that would be 6 books in total. But maybe the question is asking for the number of unique books they read together?

But if it's about the unique books, then Dolly has 2, Pandora has 1, so total unique books are 3. But the way the question is phrased, \"beide die Bücher voneinander und ihre eigenen lesen\" suggests that each reads the other's books plus their own. So Dolly reads 1 (Pandora's) + 2 (her own) = 3. Pandora reads 2 (Dolly's) + 1 (her own) = 3. So total is 3 + 3 = 6. But maybe the answer is 3, considering that they are reading the same books. Wait, but the question is about how many books they will read in total. If each reads their own and the other's, then each person reads 3 books, so combined 6. But maybe the answer is 3 because there are only 3 unique books. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again.\n\nIf Dolly has two books, let's call them Book A and Book B. Pandora has one book, Book C. When they read each other's books and their own, Dolly reads Book C (Pandora's) plus her own A and B. So she reads 3 books. Pandora reads A and B (Dolly's) plus her own C. So she also reads 3 books. So total books read by both are 3 + 3 = 6. But the actual number of distinct books is 3 (A, B, C). However, the question is about \"wie viele Bücher werden sie dann insgesamt lesen?\" which could be interpreted as the total number of books read by both, not the unique ones. So the answer would be 6. But maybe in German, \"Bücher\" here refers to the total count, not unique. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they are reading the same books, so the total unique is 3. But the way it's phrased, \"beide die Bücher voneinander und ihre eigenen lesen\" might mean that each reads the other's books and their own, leading to each reading 3 books, so total 6. But I need to be careful here. Let me check similar examples. If someone has 2 books and another has 1, and they exchange and read all, the total number of books read would be 2 (Dolly's) + 1 (Pandora's) + 1 (Pandora's) + 2 (Dolly's) = 6? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, Dolly reads her own 2 and Pandora's 1, so 3. Pandora reads her own 1 and Dolly's 2, so 3. Total is 3 + 3 = 6. So the answer is 6. But maybe the question is in German, and sometimes in such problems, they might consider the total unique books. But the wording here is \"wie viele Bücher werden sie dann insgesamt lesen?\" which is \"how many books will they read in total?\" So if each reads 3, then 6. But maybe the answer is 3, considering that they are reading the same books. But I think the correct interpretation is that each person reads their own and the other's, so total is 6.

So Dolly reads Pandora's books (which is 1) plus her own (2). Pandora reads Dolly's books (2) plus her own (1). So total books read by both would be Dolly's total plus Pandora's total.\n\nBut wait, does that count duplicates?

Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, Griffin initially had 24 fries. Then Kyle took 5 of them. So, after Kyle took his share, Griffin would have 24 minus 5, which is 19 fries left. \n\nNext, Billy took double what Kyle took. Since Kyle took 5, Billy took 2 times 5, which is 10 fries. So, subtracting that from Griffin's remaining fries, 19 minus 10 would leave Griffin with 9 fries. \n\nNow, Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \"x\". So after receiving x fries from Ginger, Griffin's total would be 9 plus x. \n\nThen, Colby took 3 fewer fries than what Kyle had taken. Kyle took 5, so Colby took 5 minus 3, which is 2 fries. Therefore, Griffin's total after Colby took his share would be (9 + x) minus 2, which simplifies to 7 + x. \n\nThe problem states that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27. Solving for x, we subtract 7 from both sides, which gives x = 20. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me go through each step once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with 24 fries. Kyle takes 5: 24 - 5 = 19. Billy takes double Kyle's amount, so 5*2=10. 19 -10 = 9. Then Ginger gives x fries: 9 + x. Then Colby takes 5 -3 = 2 fries. So 9 + x -2 = 7 + x. And that equals 27. So 7 + x =27, so x=20. That seems right. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm if I interpreted Colby's action correctly. The problem says Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle. Kyle took 5, so 5-3=2. Yes, that's correct. So Colby took 2. \n\nSo, yes, the equation is correct. Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no other interpretation. For example, could \"doppelt so viele wie Kyle\" mean something else? No, \"doppelt so viele\" is definitely double the amount Kyle took. And \"eine Handvoll\" is just a handful, which we represent as x. \n\nAnother check: If Ginger gave 20, then after that, Griffin had 9 +20=29. Then Colby took 2, so 29-2=27.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, Griffin initially had 24 fries. Then Kyle took 5 of them. So, after Kyle took his share, Griffin would have 24 minus 5, which is 19 fries left. \n\nNext, Billy took double what Kyle took. Since Kyle took 5, Billy took 2 times 5, which is 10 fries. So, subtracting that from Griffin's remaining fries, 19 minus 10 would leave Griffin with 9 fries. \n\nNow, Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \"x\". So after receiving x fries from Ginger, Griffin's total would be 9 plus x. \n\nThen, Colby took 3 fewer fries than what Kyle had taken. Kyle took 5, so Colby took 5 minus 3, which is 2 fries. Therefore, Griffin's total after Colby took his share would be (9 + x) minus 2, which simplifies to 7 + x. \n\nThe problem states that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27. Solving for x, we subtract 7 from both sides, which gives x = 20. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me go through each step once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with 24 fries. Kyle takes 5: 24 - 5 = 19. Billy takes double Kyle's amount, so 5*2=10. 19 -10 = 9. Then Ginger gives x fries: 9 + x. Then Colby takes 5 -3 = 2 fries. So 9 + x -2 = 7 + x. And that equals 27. So 7 + x =27, so x=20. That seems right. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm if I interpreted Colby's action correctly. The problem says Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle. Kyle took 5, so 5-3=2. Yes, that's correct. So Colby took 2. \n\nSo, yes, the equation is correct. Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no other interpretation. For example, could \"doppelt so viele wie Kyle\" mean something else? No, \"doppelt so viele\" is definitely double the amount Kyle took. And \"eine Handvoll\" is just a handful, which we represent as x. \n\nAnother check: If Ginger gave 20, then after that, Griffin had 9 +20=29. Then Colby took 2, so 29-2=27. Which matches the final amount. Yep, that works. So the answer should be 20.\n</think>\n\nGriffin begann mit 24 Pommes frites. Kyle nahm 5, sodass Griffin 19 übrig hatte.

So, I need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 10% discount.\n\nFirst, let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, how many hours does Jean spend on makeup each day? It's 6 hours per day. Then, how many times a week does she need it done? 4 times a week. So, per week, the total hours would be 6 hours/day * 4 days/week. That would be 24 hours per week.\n\nThen, the movie takes 5 weeks. So, over the entire duration of the movie, the total hours would be 24 hours/week * 5 weeks.

Isabelle bought party supplies for her sister's birthday. She spent different amounts on various things: $12 on cake ingredients, $43 on birthday gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on bags of snacks for the guests. Now, she's splitting the total cost equally with her two parents, so three people in total. The question is, how much does each person pay?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total amount Isabelle spent. Let me add up all those numbers. Let me write them down again to make sure I don't miss any:\n\n- Cake ingredients: $12\n- Birthday gifts: $43\n- Decorations: $15\n- Invitations: $4\n- Snacks: $22\n\nSo adding those up. Let me do it step by step. Starting with the cake ingredients and birthday gifts: 12 + 43. Hmm, 12 + 40 is 52, plus 3 is 55. Then add decorations: 55 + 15. That's 70. Then invitations: 70 + 4 = 74. Then snacks: 74 + 22. 74 + 20 is 94, plus 2 is 96. So total cost is $96?\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I added wrong. Let me add them all again:\n\n12 (cake) + 43 (gifts) = 55. Then 55 + 15 (decorations) = 70. Then 70 + 4 (invitations) = 74. Then 74 + 22 (snacks) = 96. Yeah, that seems right. So total is $96.\n\nNow, she splits this cost equally with her two parents, so three people total. So each person pays 96 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 96 divided by 3.

Isabelle bought party supplies for her sister's birthday. She spent different amounts on various things: $12 on cake ingredients, $43 on birthday gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on bags of snacks for the guests. Now, she's splitting the total cost equally with her two parents, so three people in total. The question is, how much does each person pay?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total amount Isabelle spent. Let me add up all those numbers.

Let me do it step by step. Starting with the cake ingredients and birthday gifts: 12 + 43. Hmm, 12 + 40 is 52, plus 3 is 55. Then add decorations: 55 + 15. That's 70. Then invitations: 70 + 4 = 74. Then snacks: 74 + 22. 74 + 20 is 94, plus 2 is 96. So total cost is $96?\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I added wrong. Let me add them all again:\n\n12 (cake) + 43 (gifts) = 55.

Josh wants to sell his house and figure out his profit. So, he bought the house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on repairs. Then the value of the house increased by 150%. Hmm, I need to calculate his profit here. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total cost he incurred. That would be the original purchase price plus the repair costs. So, $80,000 plus $50,000. Let me add those up: 80k + 50k is $130,000. So his total investment is $130,000.\n\nNow, the house's value increased by 150%. Wait, 150% of what? Is it 150% of the original value or 150% of the total investment? The question says \"der Wert des Hauses steigt um 150%\". In German, \"steigt um 150%\" usually means the value increases by 150% of the original value. So, if the original value was $80,000, then a 150% increase would be 1.5 times the original value. Let me confirm that. \n\nSo, original value is $80,000. A 150% increase would be 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000. So the new value is original value plus 150% of that, which is 80k + 120k = 200,000. Wait, but that seems like a 150% increase. Alternatively, sometimes people might think of percentage increase as the new value being 150% of the original, but that would be a 50% increase. Hmm, this is a common confusion. Let me check.\n\nIf something increases by 100%, it doubles. So 150% increase would be original + 150% of original, which is 2.5 times the original. So original value is $80k, 150% increase would be 80k * 2.5 = 200k. So the new value is $200,000. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"der Wert des Hauses steigt um 150%\". In German, \"um\" can mean \"by\" in the sense of an increase. So, if the value increases by 150%, that would be 150% of the original value added to the original. So yes, 80k + 150% of 80k = 80k + 120k = 200k. So the new value is $200,000.\n\nBut then, Josh's total cost was $130,000 (original 80k + repairs 50k). So his profit would be the selling price minus total cost. If he sells it for $200,000, then profit is 200k - 130k = 70,000. So $70,000 profit. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the 150% increase is on the total investment or the original value. The problem says \"der Wert des Hauses steigt um 150%\". The value of the house, which was originally $80k, so the increase is on the original value. Therefore, the new value is 80k * 2.5 = 200k. \n\nAlternatively, if the 150% was on the total investment, that would be different. But the problem states that the value of the house increases, not the total investment. So the value of the house is the original value plus the repairs? Wait, no. The repairs are part of the cost, but the value of the house is separate. The repairs might have increased the value, but the problem says the value increased by 150% due to the repairs. Wait, the problem says: \"Er kauft ein Haus für 80.000 US-Dollar und steckt anschließend 50.000 US-Dollar an Reparaturen hinein. Dadurch steigt der Wert des Hauses um 150%.\" So the repairs caused the value to increase by 150%. So the original value was 80k, then after repairs, the value is 80k + 150% of 80k = 200k. \n\nBut another way to think: maybe the 150% is the total increase from the original value. So the new value is 80k * (1 + 1.5) = 200k. So that's the same as before. \n\nTherefore, selling price is 200k. Total cost is 80k (purchase) + 50k (repairs) = 130k. Profit is 200k - 130k = 70k. So $70,000 profit. \n\nBut wait, sometimes when people talk about percentage increases, they might mean the new value is 150% of the original. But that would be a 50% increase. However, the wording here is \"steigt um 150%\", which in German is \"increases by 150%\", which is an absolute increase of 150% of the original value. So that would be 80k + 150% of 80k = 200k. \n\nAlternatively, if the value increased to 150% of the original, that would be 1.5 * 80k = 120k, which is a 50% increase. But the problem says \"steigt um 150%\", which is \"increases by 150%\", so the former interpretation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the profit is $70,000. \n\nBut let me check again. Suppose the original value is $80k. After repairs, the value increases by 150% of the original value. So 150% of 80k is 120k. So new value is 80k + 120k = 200k. Total cost is 80k + 50k = 130k. Profit is 200k - 130k = 70k. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be $70,000.\n</think>\n\nJosh kauft ein Haus für **80.000 USD** und investiert **50.000 USD** in Reparaturen.

James wants to know how many meters he runs in a week. The problem says he does 3 short-distance runs three times a week. Each short-distance run is 60 meters. Hmm, wait, let me parse that again.\n\nSo, he runs 3 times a week, and each time he does 3 short-distance runs. Each of those short runs is 60 meters. So, first, maybe I need to figure out how many runs he does in a week. If he does 3 runs per week, and each of those runs consists of 3 short-distance runs, then total runs per week would be 3 times 3? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers here.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"James beschließt, 3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe zu absolvieren.\" Translating that: James decides to do 3 short-distance runs three times a week. So, \"3-mal pro Woche\" means three times a week. Each time he does 3 short-distance runs. So each session is 3 runs, and he does that three times a week. So total number of runs per week is 3 (times per week) multiplied by 3 (runs per session). That would be 9 runs in total per week.\n\nBut wait, maybe the original German is a bit different. Let me check again. \"3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe zu absolvieren.\" So \"3-mal pro Woche\" is three times a week, and each time he does 3 Kurzstreckenläufe. So each session is 3 runs, and he does that three times a week. So total runs per week: 3 times 3 = 9 runs.\n\nEach run is 60 meters. So total meters per week would be 9 runs * 60 meters per run. Let me calculate that. 9 * 60. Well, 10*60 is 600, minus 1*60 is 540. So 540 meters in total per week.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the original question. Let me check again. The user wrote: \"James beschließt, 3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe zu absolvieren. Pro Kurzstreckenlauf läuft er 60 Meter. Wie viele Meter insgesamt läuft er pro Woche?\"\n\nSo, \"3-mal pro Woche\" is three times a week. Each time he does 3 Kurzstreckenläufe. Each Kurzstreckenlauf is 60 meters. So per week, he does 3 times (3 runs) = 9 runs. Each run is 60 meters. So 9 * 60 = 540 meters. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is that he does 3 short-distance runs each week, and each run is 60 meters. But the original says \"3-mal pro Woche 3 Kurzstreckenläufe\", which is three times a week, each time doing 3 runs. So yeah, 3 times 3 is 9 runs. So 9 * 60 = 540.

Wendi feeds her chickens three times a day, right? Each chicken gets three cups of mixed feed per day. The question is asking how many cups she needs for the last meal of the day. She has 20 chickens. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total amount of feed required per day for all the chickens. Since each chicken gets 3 cups a day, and there are 20 chickens, that would be 3 cups multiplied by 20 chickens. Let me calculate that: 3 * 20 = 60 cups total per day.\n\nNow, she feeds them three times a day. The problem says she feeds them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. \n\nTo find out how much is needed for the last meal, I subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement. That would be 60 total cups minus 40 cups already given. So, 60 - 40 = 20 cups. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Each chicken gets 3 cups a day, so 20 chickens would need 60 cups in total. If she's already given 15 in the morning and 25 in the afternoon, that's 40 cups. So the remaining for the third meal is 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The given information is that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has four times as many as Seattle. Also, Seattle has 20 sheep. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many sheep each city has individually and then add them up. Let me start with Seattle since their number is given directly. The problem states that Seattle has 20 sheep. So, Seattle = 20.\n\nNext, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if Seattle is 20, then Charleston would be 4 multiplied by 20. Let me calculate that: 4 * 20 = 80. So, Charleston has 80 sheep.\n\nNow, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally, her download speed is 2 GB per minute. But after 40% of the download is done, Windows forces a restart for updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then she has to restart the download from the beginning. I need to figure out the total time it takes for her to download the file.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem into parts. The download is interrupted after 40%, then there's a 20-minute restart, and then she has to start over. Wait, does that mean she has to download the entire 200 GB again after the restart? Or does she continue from where she left off? The question says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which translates to \"start over from the beginning again.\" So, after the restart, she has to download the entire 200 GB again. That seems a bit harsh, but okay.\n\nSo, the process is: first, she downloads 40% of 200 GB, then the system restarts for 20 minutes, then she starts over and downloads the entire 200 GB again. Wait, but that would mean she ends up with two copies of the file? Or maybe the first 40% is lost, and she has to download the whole thing again? The problem says \"den Download noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which might mean that after the restart, the download is restarted from the beginning, so the first 40% is not saved. Therefore, she has to download the entire 200 GB twice? But that seems like a lot. Let me check the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"nachdem 40 % des Downloads abgeschlossen sind, erzwingt Windows einen Neustart, um Updates zu installieren, was 20 Minuten dauert. Danach muss Carla den Download noch einmal ganz neu starten.\" So after 40% is done, the restart happens, and then she has to restart the download from the beginning. So, the first 40% is already downloaded, but then the restart happens, and then she has to start over. Wait, but if the download was interrupted, maybe the downloaded 40% is lost? Or does she continue from there? The problem says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which is \"start over again from the beginning.\" So, she has to download the entire 200 GB again, even though she had already downloaded 40% before the restart. That seems like a lot, but maybe that's how it is.\n\nSo, the total time would be the time to download 40% plus the 20 minutes for the restart, plus the time to download 100% again. Wait, but that would be 40% + 100% = 140% of the file. But maybe the first 40% is already done, and then after the restart, she has to download the entire 200 GB again. But that would mean she ends up with two copies? Or maybe the first 40% is not saved, so she has to download the whole thing again. The problem is a bit ambiguous here, but given the wording, I think it's the latter: after the restart, she has to start the download from the beginning, so the first 40% is lost, and she has to download the entire 200 GB again. Therefore, the total time is the time to download 40% (which is 40% of 200 GB) plus 20 minutes for the restart, plus the time to download 200 GB again.\n\nWait, but that would be 40% of 200 GB, which is 80 GB, then 20 minutes, then another 200 GB. So total data downloaded is 80 + 200 = 280 GB, but the actual file is 200 GB. But maybe the question is just about the time, not the data. So, the time would be:\n\nTime for first 40%: (0.4 * 200 GB) / 2 GB per minute = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.\n\nThen 20 minutes for the restart.\n\nThen time for the full download again: 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.\n\nTotal time: 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.\n\nBut wait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after the restart, she doesn't have to download the entire 200 GB again, but just the remaining 60%? But the problem says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which is \"start over from the beginning again.\" So, that would imply that she has to start the download from the beginning, meaning the entire 200 GB again. Therefore, the total time is indeed 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.\n\nBut let me think again. If the download was interrupted at 40%, and then after the restart, she has to start over, but maybe the download is resumed from where it left off? But the problem says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which is \"start over again from the beginning,\" so that would mean she has to download the entire file again, not resuming. Therefore, the total time is as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 40% is already downloaded, and after the restart, she continues from there. But the problem says she has to restart the download from the beginning, so that would mean she has to download the entire 200 GB again, even though she had already downloaded 40% before. That seems inefficient, but maybe that's the case.\n\nSo, the answer would be 40 minutes (for the first 40%) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (full download) = 160 minutes. Therefore, 160 minutes total.\n\nBut let me check if there's another interpretation. Suppose that after the restart, she can continue the download from where it left off. Then the total time would be 40 minutes (for 40%) + 20 minutes (restart) + time to download remaining 60% (which is 0.6*200 / 2 = 60 minutes). Total time: 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes. But the problem says \"noch einmal ganz neu starten,\" which is \"start over again from the beginning,\" so that would imply that she has to start the download from the beginning, not resuming. Therefore, the first interpretation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 160 minutes.\n</think>\n\nCarla muss die Datei in zwei Phasen herunterladen, da der Download nach 40 % unterbrochen wird und anschließend neu gestartet werden muss. \n\n1. **Erster Teil des Downloads (40 %):**  \n   - Größe: $ 40\\% \\times 200\\, \\text{GB} = 80\\, \\text{GB} $  \n   - Zeit: $ \\frac{80\\, \\text{GB}}{2\\, \\text{GB/Minute}} = 40\\, \\text{Minuten} $\n\n2. **Windows-Update (20 Minuten):**  \n   - Zeit: $ 20\\, \\text{Minuten} $\n\n3. **Neuer Download (vollständig):**  \n   - Größe: $ 200\\, \\text{GB} $  \n   - Zeit: $ \\frac{200\\, \\text{GB}}{2\\, \\text{GB/Minute}} = 100\\, \\text{Minuten} $\n\n**Gesamte Zeit:**  \n$ 40\\, \\text{Minuten} + 20\\, \\text{Minuten} + 100\\, \\text{Minuten} = 160\\, \\text{Minuten} $\n\n**Antwort:**  \nDas Herunterladen der Datei dauert insgesamt **160 Minuten**."]], "filtered_resps": ["160"], "doc_hash": "e5a94732c5b821a88ab2b691750e77f7d97d26e9eae82c4f1c8605cf36bc2687", "prompt_hash": "d0273511c85c8efb184d91bb1d0e984842df6928783a72f11ab08c49c812eb62", "target_hash": "a512db2741cd20693e4b16f19891e72b9ff12cead72761fc5e92d2aaf34740c1", "exact_match": 1.0}

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, then turns around because he forgot something important. Then he tries to get home within 4 hours, but gets stuck in traffic for the first 2 hours. Then he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, and then the remaining time of 4 hours at 80 mph. Wait, the question is how far away from home is he after these 4 hours?\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out his position after the initial 3 hours. Then, when he turns around, he's trying to go back home. But the problem is that he has a total of 4 hours to get home, but he gets stuck in traffic for 2 hours, then drives for half an hour at 30 mph, and then the remaining time (which is 4 hours total?) Wait, maybe I need to parse the timeline correctly.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst part: John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. So the distance from home is 3 * 60 = 180 miles. Then he realizes he forgot something and turns around. So now he's heading back home.\n\nNow, he tries to get home within 4 hours. But during these 4 hours, he gets stuck in traffic for the first 2 hours. So during those 2 hours, he's not moving. Then, after the traffic, he drives for half an hour (which is 0.5 hours) at 30 mph. Then, the remaining time of 4 hours... Wait, hold on. The total time he has to get home is 4 hours. But he spent 2 hours in traffic, then 0.5 hours driving, so the remaining time would be 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. But the problem says \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the timeline.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Er versucht, innerhalb von 4 Stunden nach Hause zu kommen, verbringt allerdings die ersten 2 Stunden im Stau. Die anschließende halbe Stunde fährt er mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 30 Meilen/Stunde, bevor er die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\"\n\nWait, maybe the 4 hours is the total time he has to get home. So he starts trying to get home, and during that 4-hour period, he spends 2 hours in traffic, then 0.5 hours at 30 mph, and then the remaining time (which would be 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. But the problem says \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\" Hmm, maybe the translation is a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal German: \"Er versucht, innerhalb von 4 Stunden nach Hause zu kommen, verbringt allerdings die ersten 2 Stunden im Stau. Die anschließende halbe Stunde fährt er mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 30 Meilen/Stunde, bevor er die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\"\n\nWait, \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden\" – that might mean that after the first 2 hours and the half hour, he has the remaining time of 4 hours? But that doesn't make sense because 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours, so remaining time would be 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours. But the problem says \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden\" – maybe it's a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the total time he has is 4 hours, and after the first 2 hours in traffic, then 0.5 hours driving, then the remaining time (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. That seems more logical.\n\nSo, let's structure it:\n\nTotal time available to get home: 4 hours.\n\nTime in traffic: 2 hours (so he doesn't move during this time).\n\nThen, after traffic, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.\n\nThen, the remaining time is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours, during which he drives at 80 mph.\n\nSo, during these 4 hours, he moves back towards home in three segments:\n\n1. 2 hours in traffic: 0 miles covered.\n\n2. 0.5 hours at 30 mph: distance covered = 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles towards home.\n\n3. 1.5 hours at 80 mph: distance covered = 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles towards home.\n\nTotal distance covered towards home during the 4 hours: 15 + 120 = 135 miles.\n\nBut initially, he was 180 miles away from home. So after driving back 135 miles, his distance from home is 180 - 135 = 45 miles.\n\nWait, but that seems straightforward. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says he turns around after the initial 3 hours. So he was 180 miles away from home. Then he starts heading back. The total time he has to get home is 4 hours. But during those 4 hours, he gets stuck in traffic for 2 hours, then drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, then the remaining time (which is 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. So total distance covered back towards home is 15 + 120 = 135 miles. Therefore, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that the 4 hours is not the total time from when he turned around, but something else? Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"John fährt 3 Stunden lang mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 60 Meilen/Stunde und dreht dann um, weil er bemerkt, dass er etwas ganz Wichtiges zu Hause vergessen hat. Er versucht, innerhalb von 4 Stunden nach Hause zu kommen, verbringt allerdings die ersten 2 Stunden im Stau. Die anschließende halbe Stunde fährt er mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 30 Meilen/Stunde, bevor er die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann. Wie weit weg von zu Hause ist er am Ende dieser 4 Stunden?\"\n\nSo, after turning around, he tries to get home within 4 hours. So the 4 hours starts when he turns around. So during those 4 hours, he spends 2 hours in traffic, then 0.5 hours at 30 mph, then the remaining time (which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. Therefore, total distance covered back is 15 + 120 = 135 miles. So he was 180 miles away, now he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden mit 80 Meilen/Stunde weiterfahren kann.\" Maybe \"die verbleibende Zeit von 4 Stunden\" is supposed to mean that after the first 2 hours and 0.5 hours, he has 4 hours left? But that would be inconsistent with the total time. Alternatively, maybe the translation is that after the first 2 hours and 0.5 hours, he has the remaining time (which is 4 hours minus the time already spent) to drive at 80 mph. But that would be 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours, as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the 4 hours is not the total time, but the time he has to get home, but he didn't manage to do it in 4 hours. Wait, but the question says \"am Ende dieser 4 Stunden\" – so after these 4 hours, how far is he from home. So regardless of whether he made it home or not, after 4 hours of trying to get home, how far is he from home.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct: 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut let me check again step by step.\n\nFirst, initial trip: 3 hours at 60 mph: 3*60=180 miles from home.\n\nThen, he turns around and starts heading back. The total time he has to get home is 4 hours. So during these 4 hours:\n\n- First 2 hours: stuck in traffic, so 0 miles.\n\n- Then, next 0.5 hours: driving at 30 mph. So distance covered: 0.5*30=15 miles towards home.\n\n- Then, remaining time: 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. Driving at 80 mph: 1.5*80=120 miles towards home.\n\nTotal distance covered back: 15 + 120 = 135 miles.\n\nTherefore, distance from home: 180 - 135 = 45 miles.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be 45 miles away from home.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: maybe the 4 hours is not the total time from turning around, but the total time from the start? But the problem says \"Er versucht, innerhalb von 4 Stunden nach Hause zu kommen\" – so after turning around, he has 4 hours to get home. So the 4 hours is the time from when he turned around. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the 4 hours includes the initial 3 hours? No, because he turned around after 3 hours, and then starts trying to get home within 4 hours. So the 4 hours is separate from the initial 3 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 45 miles away from home.\n</think>\n\nJohn fährt zunächst 3 Stunden mit 60 Meilen/Stunde, wodurch er sich 180 Meilen von zu Hause entfernt.

Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week. Then, for any overtime hours beyond that, she gets paid 1.2 times the normal rate. This week, she worked 45 hours. So, I need to calculate her total earnings for the week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many hours are regular and how many are overtime. Since she works 45 hours in total and the regular hours are up to 40, the overtime hours would be 45 minus 40. That's 5 hours of overtime.\n\nNow, the regular pay is straightforward. For the first 40 hours, she gets $10 per hour. So, 40 hours multiplied by $10. Let me calculate that: 40 * 10 = $400. That's the regular part of her pay.\n\nNext, the overtime pay. The overtime rate is 1.2 times the normal rate. The normal rate is $10, so 1.2 times that would be 10 * 1.2. Let me do that multiplication. 10 * 1.2 is $12 per overtime hour.

I need to figure out the total number of downloads for this program over three months. The problem says that in the first month, there were 60 downloads. Then, in the second month, the number of downloads was three times as high as the first month. But then in the third month, it dropped by 30% compared to the second month. I need to add up all three months' downloads.\n\nFirst, let me break it down step by step. The first month is straightforward: 60 downloads. Got that. The second month is three times the first month. So, three times 60. Let me calculate that. 3 * 60 is 180. So, 180 downloads in the second month. That seems right.\n\nNow, the third month is a bit trickier. It says the downloads \"brach dann aber im dritten Monat um 30 % ein.\" Hmm, \"brach ein\" translates to \"broke\" or \"dropped\" in English. So, the downloads decreased by 30% compared to the second month. So, I need to find 30% of the second month's downloads and subtract that from the second month's total to get the third month's downloads.\n\nWait, or is it that the third month's downloads are 30% of the second month's? No, the wording is \"um 30 % ein\" which is \"by 30% less\" or \"a decrease of 30%.\" So, if something decreases by 30%, it's 100% - 30% = 70% of the original. So, the third month's downloads would be 70% of the second month's downloads.\n\nLet me confirm that. If the downloads \"brach um 30% ein,\" that means they dropped by 30%, so the remaining is 70% of the previous month. So, yes, 70% of 180. Let me calculate that. 180 * 0.7. Hmm, 180 * 0.7 is 126. So, 126 downloads in the third month.\n\nNow, to find the total over three months, I need to add the downloads from each month: first month (60) + second month (180) + third month (126).

The key steps were calculating the second month's downloads correctly as three times the first, then applying the 30% decrease to the second month's number for the third month, and then summing them all up.

I need to calculate the total cost of all the pastries Toula bought. She bought three different items: donuts, mini-cupcakes, and mini-cheesecakes. Each is sold by the dozen, so I need to figure out the cost for each type and then add them all together.\n\nFirst, the donuts. She bought 3 dozen, and each dozen costs $68. So, for donuts, it's 3 times 68. Let me do that multiplication. 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 8 is 24, so 180 + 24 = 204. So donuts cost $204.\n\nNext, the mini-cupcakes. She bought 2 dozen at $80 per dozen. That's straightforward: 2 times 80. 2 times 80 is 160. So mini-cupcakes are $160.\n\nThen the mini-cheesecakes. She bought 6 dozen at $55 per dozen. Hmm, 6 times 55. Let me break that down. 5 times 55 is 275, and 1 times 55 is 55, so 275 + 55 = 330. So the cheesecakes cost $330.\n\nNow, I need to add all three amounts together: $204 (donuts) + $160 (cupcakes) + $330 (cheesecakes). Let's add them step by step. \n\nFirst, 204 + 160. 200 + 160 is 360, and then +4 is 364. Then add 330 to that. 364 + 330. Let's see, 300 + 300 is 600, 60 + 30 is 90, and 4 + 0 is 4. So 600 + 90 is 690, plus 4 is 694. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 364 + 330. Maybe another way: 364 + 300 = 664, then +30 = 694. Yeah, that's correct.

Carlos plants a lemon tree that costs $90. Each year, it produces 7 lemons, which he sells for $1.50 each. But it also costs $3 per year to water and fertilize the tree. The question is, how many years does it take before he starts making a profit?\n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out the total cost and the total revenue over the years. The initial cost is $90 for planting the tree. Then, every year, there's an additional cost of $3 for maintenance. On the revenue side, each year he gets 7 lemons times $1.50 each. Let me calculate that first.\n\nSo, revenue per year: 7 lemons * $1.50 = $10.50 per year. Then, the cost per year is $3. So, the profit per year would be $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year. But wait, there's also the initial cost of $90. So, he needs to cover that initial cost before he starts making a profit, right?\n\nSo, the total cost is $90 plus $3 per year. The total revenue is $10.50 per year. So, the net profit each year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50, but he has to first recover the initial $90. So, the question is, how many years does it take for the total revenue to exceed the total cost?\n\nLet me set up an equation. Let's let x be the number of years. Total revenue after x years is 10.50 * x. Total cost is 90 + 3 * x. We need to find the smallest x where 10.50x > 90 + 3x.\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides: 7.50x > 90. Then, divide both sides by 7.50: x > 90 / 7.50. Let me calculate that. 90 divided by 7.5. Well, 7.5 times 12 is 90, because 7.5*10=75, 7.5*2=15, so 75+15=90. So, 90 divided by 7.5 is 12. So, x > 12. That means after 12 years, he would have broken even, but since we need to make a profit, it would be 13 years? Wait, but let me check.\n\nWait, if x is 12, then total revenue is 10.50*12 = $126. Total cost is 90 + 3*12 = 90 + 36 = $126. So, at 12 years, he breaks even. So, to start making a profit, he needs to go into the 13th year. Therefore, the answer is 13 years.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's check year by year. Let's see:\n\nYear 1: Revenue 10.50, cost 3, net profit 7.50. But total cost is 90 + 3 = 93. So, total profit after 1 year is 10.50 - 93 = -82.50. Still in the red.\n\nYear 2: Revenue 21, cost 6, total revenue 21, total cost 90 + 6 = 96. Profit: 21 - 96 = -75.\n\nYear 3: 31.50 - 99 = -67.50.\n\nContinuing this way, each year the profit increases by 7.50. So, after x years, the total profit is 7.50x - 90. Wait, because each year he makes 7.50 profit, but he has to subtract the initial 90. So, 7.50x - 90 > 0. So, 7.50x > 90, x > 12. So, same result. So, after 12 years, he has 7.50*12 = 90, so total profit is 0. So, he breaks even at 12 years. Therefore, to have a profit, it's 13 years.\n\nBut the question says \"bevor er mit dem Zitronenbaum Geld verdient\" which translates to \"before he starts making money with the lemon tree.\" So, does that mean when does he start making a profit, which would be after 12 years? Wait, but at 12 years, he breaks even. So, he hasn't made a profit yet. So, the first year he makes a profit is year 13. Therefore, the answer is 13 years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the initial cost is a one-time cost, and the annual costs are ongoing. So, the total cost is 90 + 3x, and the total revenue is 10.50x. So, when does 10.50x > 90 + 3x? Which is when x > 12. So, 13 years. So, the answer is 13 years.\n</think>\n\nCarlos muss zunächst die Anfangskosten von 90 USD und die jährlichen Kosten von 3 USD abdecken, bevor er Gewinn macht.

Melanie is a salesperson who sold vacuum cleaners. The problem says she has a third of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, 2 more in the red house, and half of the remaining in the orange house. She ends up with 5 vacuum cleaners left. The question is, how many did she start with?\n\nHmm, I need to figure out the initial number. Let me break it down step by step. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with \"x\".\n\nFirst, she sold a third of them in the green house. So that's (1/3)x. Then, she sold 2 more in the red house. So after the green and red houses, she has sold (1/3)x + 2. Therefore, the remaining vacuum cleaners after green and red would be x - [(1/3)x + 2]. Let me compute that:\n\nx - (1/3)x - 2 = (2/3)x - 2.\n\nThen, she sold half of the remaining in the orange house. So half of (2/3)x - 2 is [(2/3)x - 2]/2. After selling that, she has the other half left, which is also [(2/3)x - 2]/2. And this is equal to 5, according to the problem.\n\nSo, [(2/3)x - 2]/2 = 5. Let me solve this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (2/3)x - 2 = 10.\n\nThen add 2 to both sides: (2/3)x = 12.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/2: x = 12 * (3/2) = 18.\n\nWait, so she started with 18 vacuum cleaners? Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nStart with 18. Green house: 1/3 of 18 is 6. So she sold 6 there. Then 2 more in the red house, so total sold so far is 6 + 2 = 8. Remaining is 18 - 8 = 10. Then she sold half of the remaining in the orange house, which is 5. So she sold 5 in orange, leaving 5. That matches the problem statement. So yes, 18 seems correct.\n\nBut let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The key steps are:\n\n1. Total: x\n2. Green: (1/3)x\n3. Red: 2\n4. Remaining after green and red: x - (1/3)x - 2 = (2/3)x - 2\n5. Orange: half of that, so [(2/3)x - 2]/2\n6. Remaining after orange: same as above, which is 5.\n\nSo equation: [(2/3)x - 2]/2 = 5. Multiply both sides by 2: (2/3)x - 2 = 10. Then (2/3)x = 12. Multiply by 3/2: x = 18. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If after selling in green and red, she had (2/3)x - 2 left, and then half of that is sold in orange, leaving half. So half of (2/3)x - 2 is 5. Therefore, (2/3)x - 2 = 10. Then solving gives x = 18. All steps seem consistent.\n\nI think that's the right answer. Let me just confirm once more with the numbers:\n\nStart with 18.\n\nGreen: 18 / 3 = 6 sold. Remaining: 12.\n\nRed: 2 sold. Remaining: 12 - 2 = 10.\n\nOrange: half of 10 is 5 sold. Remaining: 5.

I need to figure out what percentage of the 20 students signed up for Hip-Hop. The problem says that 20% chose Contemporary Dance, then 25% of the remaining students chose Jazz Dance, and the rest went for Hip-Hop. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 20 students in total. Let me start with the Contemporary Dance. 20% of 20 students. To calculate that, I can do 20% of 20. 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal. So 0.20 multiplied by 20. Let me compute that: 0.20 * 20 = 4. So, 4 students chose Contemporary Dance.\n\nNow, the problem says that 25% of the remaining students chose Jazz Dance. The remaining students after Contemporary Dance would be the total minus those who chose Contemporary. So, 20 total minus 4 who did Contemporary equals 16 students left. So, 25% of these 16 students are Jazz Dance. Let me calculate that. 25% is 0.25, so 0.25 * 16. Hmm, 0.25 times 16 is 4. So, 4 students chose Jazz Dance.\n\nNow, the rest of the students are those who signed up for Hip-Hop. So, total students minus Contemporary minus Jazz. That would be 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students. So, 12 students chose Hip-Hop. Now, the question asks for the percentage of all students who signed up for Hip-Hop. So, 12 out of 20. To find the percentage, I can do (12 / 20) * 100. Let me compute that. 12 divided by 20 is 0.6, and 0.6 times 100 is 60%. So, 60% of the students chose Hip-Hop.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that right. 20% of 20 is 4, that's correct. Then 25% of the remaining 16 is 4, yes. Then 20 - 4 - 4 = 12. 12/20 is indeed 0.6, so 60%. That seems right. But let me think again if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says \"25% of the rest\" for Jazz Dance. The rest after Contemporary, which is 16, so 25% of 16 is 4. Then the rest is 12. So yes, 12 students. So 12/20 is 60%. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do this using percentages without calculating the actual numbers. Let's see. Total is 100%. Contemporary is 20%, so the remaining is 80%. Then 25% of that 80% is Jazz Dance. So, 25% of 80% is 0.25 * 80% = 20%. Therefore, Jazz Dance is 20%, and the rest is 100% - 20% (Contemporary) - 20% (Jazz) = 60% Hip-Hop. Oh, that's another way to look at it. So that confirms the answer is 60%.\n\nSo both methods give me 60%, so I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The key was to first take 20% of the total for Contemporary, then 25% of the remaining for Jazz, and the rest is Hip-Hop. Either by calculating the numbers or by working with percentages directly, the result is 60%.\n</think>\n\nIn einer Tanzstunde mit 20 Schülern:\n\n1. **Contemporary Dance**:  \n   20 % von 20 Schülern = $ 0{,}20 \\times 20 = 4 $ Schüler.\n\n2. **Jazz Dance**:  \n   Der Rest nach Contemporary Dance: $ 20 - 4 = 16 $ Schüler.  \n   25 % von 16 Schülern = $ 0{,}25 \\times 16 = 4 $ Schüler.\n\n3. **Hip-Hop**:  \n   Restliche Schüler: $ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 $ Schüler.  \n   Prozentual: $ \\frac{12}{20} \\times 100 = 60\\% $.\n\n**Antwort:** 60 % aller Schüler haben sich für Hip-Hop angemeldet."]], "filtered_resps": ["60"], "doc_hash": "e455de0212ac8c8689e4b3f4c65cf57ad1d9eee56ae1298b51d3daeb0f00a29b", "prompt_hash": "ee4881e053b9b734537967517d6a81d74785af3c5a02e6b075776bf7e1c3a62a", "target_hash": "39fa9ec190eee7b6f4dff1100d6343e10918d044c75eac8f9e9a2596173f80c9", "exact_match": 1.0}

The trader has to choose between buying jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. The financial advisor says the jewelry market will grow by 2.5% and the electronics market by 1.2% in the same month. The goal is to maximize profit, so I need to calculate the profit from each option and see which one is higher.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is meant by the market growth. If the market is growing by a certain percentage, does that mean the value of the items increases by that percentage? So, if the trader buys jewelry now, by the end of the month, its value would be 5,000 plus 2.5% of 5,000. Similarly for electronics, 8,000 plus 1.2% of 8,000. But wait, the question is about profit. So, if the trader buys the items now and sells them at the end of the month, the profit would be the increase in value. But is that the case here?\n\nWait, the problem says the trader wants to make a purchase decision. So maybe he's buying the items now and then selling them later. But the problem doesn't mention any cost of purchase or selling price. Hmm. Wait, maybe the profit is just the appreciation of the items' value. So if he buys the jewelry for $5,000 and sells it at the end of the month when the market has grown by 2.5%, then his selling price would be 5,000 * 1.025. Similarly for electronics, 8,000 * 1.012. Then the profit would be the selling price minus the initial cost. So for jewelry, profit is 5,000 * 0.025, and for electronics, 8,000 * 0.012. Then compare the two profits.\n\nLet me check that. If the market grows by 2.5%, then the value increases by 2.5% of the original amount. So the profit would be 2.5% of 5,000, which is 5,000 * 0.025 = 125. For electronics, 8,000 * 0.012 = 96. So the profit from jewelry is higher. Therefore, the trader should choose jewelry, and the maximum profit would be $125.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to consider the total value at the end of the month. If the trader buys the items and sells them, the total value would be 5,000 * 1.025 = 5,125 for jewelry, and 8,000 * 1.012 = 8,096 for electronics. But the profit is the difference between the selling price and the purchase price. So for jewelry, 5,125 - 5,000 = 125, and for electronics, 8,096 - 8,000 = 96. So yes, the profit is indeed 125 vs. 96. Therefore, the maximum profit is $125.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"Gewinn maximieren\" which is \"maximize profit\". So the answer is $125. But let me make sure there's no other interpretation. Maybe the trader is not selling the items but just holding them, but the problem states that the markets are growing, so the profit would be the increase in value. Alternatively, if the trader is buying the items and then selling them, the profit is the appreciation. So I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a different approach? For example, if the trader has a certain amount of money to invest, but the problem states the value of the items. Wait, the problem says the trader wants to make a purchase decision between two options: buying jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics worth $8,000. So he has to choose between spending $5,000 on jewelry or $8,000 on electronics. The question is, which option gives a higher profit at the end of the month. So the profit is the increase in value of the items. Therefore, the answer is $125 for jewelry and $96 for electronics, so the maximum profit is $125.\n\nYes, that seems right.

The problem is about two trains leaving San Rafael at the same time. They both go west for 80 miles on the first day, and then north for 150 miles the next day. The question is asking for the total distance each train travels over the two days. Hmm, seems straightforward, but maybe there's a trick here?\n\nWait, the problem says they start at the same time and go west for 80 miles. Then the next day they go north for 150 miles. So each day they travel a certain distance. The total distance would just be the sum of the two legs, right? So 80 miles plus 150 miles. That would be 230 miles. But maybe I'm missing something because sometimes these problems have a catch.\n\nWait, the question is in German, but the answer is in English. Let me check again. The problem states that both trains leave San Rafael at the same time, go west for 80 miles, then the next day go north for 150 miles. The question is asking for the total distance each train travels in the two days. So, if they go west for 80 miles on day one and north for 150 miles on day two, the total distance is 80 + 150 = 230 miles. That seems too simple. Maybe the question is trying to trick me into calculating the straight-line distance between the starting point and the final position? But the question specifically says \"Strecke legt jeder der Züge in den beiden Tagen zurück,\" which translates to \"distance each train travels over the two days.\" In German, \"Strecke\" can sometimes mean the total path length, not the straight-line distance. So if they go west 80 and then north 150, the total distance is indeed 230 miles. But maybe the problem is a classic Pythagorean theorem question where they want the straight-line distance from San Rafael to the final point? Let me think.\n\nIf the first day they go west 80 miles, then the next day north 150 miles, their path forms a right-angled triangle with legs 80 and 150. The straight-line distance would be sqrt(80² + 150²). Let me calculate that. 80 squared is 6400, 150 squared is 22500. Adding them gives 28900. The square root of 28900 is 170. So the straight-line distance is 170 miles. But the question is about the total distance traveled, not the displacement. So if they ask for the total distance, it's 80 + 150 = 230. But maybe the problem is phrased in a way that's confusing. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Welche Strecke legt jeder der Züge in den beiden Tagen zurück?\" Translating that: \"What distance does each of the trains cover in the two days?\" In German, \"Strecke\" can sometimes be used for both distance and displacement, but in the context of a journey, it's more likely to refer to the total path length. However, sometimes in physics, \"Strecke\" is the total distance traveled, while \"Verschiebung\" is displacement. So if the problem is from a math context, maybe they want the straight-line distance. But the problem says they go west and then north, so the total distance is 230. But maybe the answer is 170? Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Zwei Züge verlassen San Rafael zur selben Zeit. Sie beginnen, nach Westen zu fahren und legen beide 80 Meilen zurück. Am nächsten Tag fahren sie gen Norden und legen 150 Meilen zurück.\" So they start at the same time, go west for 80 miles, then the next day go north for 150 miles. So each day they travel those distances. So total distance is 80 + 150 = 230. But maybe the problem is a trick question where they are asking for the straight-line distance from San Rafael to the final position, which is 170. But the wording is \"Strecke legt jeder der Züge in den beiden Tagen zurück,\" which is \"distance each train travels in the two days.\" That should be the total path length, not the straight-line distance. So the answer is 230 miles. But I need to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where \"Strecke\" refers to the displacement. But in that case, the answer would be 170. However, in common language, when someone asks how much distance a train has traveled, they usually mean the total path length. So I think the answer is 230 miles. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems are designed to test the Pythagorean theorem. Let me check if there's any other possible interpretation.\n\nWait, the problem says both trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They go west for 80 miles, then the next day north for 150 miles. So each train's journey is 80 miles west and then 150 miles north. So the total distance each train travels is 80 + 150 = 230 miles. Therefore, the answer should be 230 miles. But maybe the problem is in a different context where they want the straight-line distance. However, the question specifically says \"Strecke legt jeder der Züge in den beiden Tagen zurück,\" which is \"distance each train travels in the two days.\" That should be the total distance traveled, not the displacement. So I think the answer is 230 miles. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems can be tricky. Let me confirm with an example. If a car goes 10 miles east and then 10 miles north, the total distance is 20 miles, while the displacement is sqrt(200) ≈ 14.14 miles. So in that case, the answer would be 20. So similarly here, the answer should be 230. Therefore, I think the answer is 230 miles.\n</think>\n\nDie beiden Züge legen jeweils am ersten Tag 80 Meilen nach Westen und am nächsten Tag 150 Meilen nach Norden zurück.

She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours per week as a teacher and 15 hours per week as a coach. Wait, hold on, the wording says \"35 Wochen pro Woche als Lehrerin\" – that might be a translation error. Wait, \"35 Wochen pro Woche\" doesn't make sense. Maybe it's supposed to be \"35 Stunden pro Woche\" (35 hours per week) as a teacher? Because \"Wochen\" is weeks, so \"35 Wochen pro Woche\" would be 35 weeks per week, which is impossible. So probably a typo. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Jill bekommt 20 US-Dollar pro Stunde für den Unterricht als Lehrerin und 30 US-Dollar als Cheerleader-Coach. Wenn sie 50 Wochen pro Jahr arbeitet, 35 Wochen pro Woche als Lehrerin und 15 Stunden pro Woche als Coach, wie hoch ist dann ihr Jahresgehalt?\"\n\nWait, \"35 Wochen pro Woche als Lehrerin\" – that's definitely a mistake. It should be \"35 Stunden pro Woche\" (35 hours per week) as a teacher. Because otherwise, 35 weeks per week doesn't make sense. So I think that's a translation error. So assuming that, let's proceed.\n\nSo, Jill works 50 weeks a year. As a teacher, she works 35 hours per week, and as a coach, 15 hours per week. So first, calculate her weekly earnings from each job, then multiply by 50 weeks.\n\nFirst, teacher: 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700 per week.\n\nCoach: 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450 per week.\n\nTotal weekly earnings: $700 + $450 = $1,150 per week.\n\nAnnual salary: $1,150/week * 50 weeks = $57,500.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If she works 50 weeks a year, and each week she works 35 hours teaching and 15 hours coaching, then yes, that's correct. So total per week is 35*20 + 15*30 = 700 + 450 = 1150. Multiply by 50 weeks: 1150*50. Let me compute that again. 1000*50=50,000, 150*50=7,500. So total 57,500. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"50 Wochen pro Jahr arbeitet, 35 Wochen pro Woche als Lehrerin und 15 Stunden pro Woche als Coach\". If the original had \"35 Wochen\" instead of \"35 Stunden\", that would be a problem. But given that \"15 Stunden pro Woche\" is correct, then \"35 Wochen\" must be a typo. So I think the correct answer is $57,500.\n</think>\n\nJill's Jahresgehalt kann wie folgt berechnet werden:\n\n1. **Stunden pro Woche:**\n   - Lehrerin: 35 Stunden/Week\n   - Cheerleader-Coach: 15 Stunden/Week\n\n2. **Stundenlohn:**\n   - Lehrerin: $20/Stunde\n   - Cheerleader-Coach: $30/Stunde\n\n3. **Wöchentliche Einnahmen:**\n   - Lehrerin: $35 \\text{ Stunden} \\times 20 \\text{ USD} = 700 \\text{ USD}$\n   - Cheerleader-Coach: $15 \\text{ Stunden} \\times 30 \\text{ USD} = 450 \\text{ USD}$\n   - **Gesamt pro Woche:** $700 + 450 = 1150 \\text{ USD}$\n\n4. **Jahresgehalt:**\n   - $1150 \\text{ USD/Week} \\times 50 \\text{ Wochen} = 57500 \\text{ USD}$\n\n**Antwort:** Jill's Jahresgehalt beträgt **57.500 US-Dollar**."]], "filtered_resps": ["57.500"], "doc_hash": "2f49111184d33f080be9ce1968c9364f595d03bd1663248cb51dec53d88d03cc", "prompt_hash": "05dcfaf8e8f42d98ace39f295b5fe90f49f68f1072de4daac400c1b5e191a13a", "target_hash": "96407ee2a95ce898f78226551cb3b08647ba61d8081024aa487de77d66a42cda", "exact_match": 1.0}

Claire makes an omelet with 3 eggs every morning for breakfast. The question is asking how many dozen eggs she eats in 4 weeks. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are in 4 weeks. Since one week has 7 days, 4 weeks would be 4 times 7. Let me calculate that: 4 * 7 = 28 days. So, there are 28 days in total.\n\nNow, Claire makes an omelet every morning, which means she uses 3 eggs each day. So, over 28 days, the total number of eggs she uses would be 3 eggs per day multiplied by 28 days. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 28. Hmm, 3*20 is 60 and 3*8 is 24, so 60+24=84. So, she uses 84 eggs in total.\n\nBut the question asks for the number of dozen eggs. Since one dozen is 12 eggs, I need to convert 84 eggs into dozens. To do that, I divide the total number of eggs by 12. So, 84 divided by 12. Let me compute that: 12*7 is 84, so 84/12 = 7. Therefore, she eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. Days in 4 weeks: 4*7=28, that's correct. Eggs per day: 3, so 28*3=84. Then 84 divided by 12 is indeed 7. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the answer should be 7 dozen eggs.\n</think>\n\nClaire bereitet jeden Morgen ein Omelett aus 3 Eiern zu.

Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She walks the first 4 miles in the first hour, then the next 2 miles in the next hour. She wants to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike. The question is, what speed does she need to walk the remaining distance?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total time she has to complete the hike if she wants an average speed of 4 mph. Since average speed is total distance divided by total time, I can rearrange that formula to find total time. Total time would be total distance divided by average speed. So, 12 miles divided by 4 mph equals 3 hours. So she needs to finish the entire 12 miles in 3 hours.\n\nNow, she's already walked for 2 hours. In the first hour, she did 4 miles, then in the second hour, she did 2 miles. So that's 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours. That means she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to go. And she has 3 total hours minus the 2 hours she's already spent, which is 1 hour left. So she has 1 hour to walk the remaining 6 miles.\n\nWait, that seems really fast. 6 miles in 1 hour would be 6 mph. Is that right? Let me check again.\n\nTotal distance: 12 miles. Desired average speed: 4 mph. So total time needed: 12 / 4 = 3 hours. Correct.\n\nTime already spent: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours. Distance covered: 4 + 2 = 6 miles. Remaining distance: 12 - 6 = 6 miles. Remaining time: 3 - 2 = 1 hour. So required speed: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph. Yeah, that seems correct. Maybe she needs to speed up a lot for the last part. But maybe I made a mistake in the time?\n\nWait, the problem says she walks the first 4 miles in the first hour, then the next two miles in the next hour. So that's two hours total, right? So she has 1 hour left. So yes, 6 miles in 1 hour. So 6 mph. That seems high, but maybe that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the question is about average speed over the entire trip, so maybe I need to consider the total time. Let me think again.\n\nAverage speed is total distance over total time. She wants an average of 4 mph for the entire 12 miles. So total time must be 12 / 4 = 3 hours. She has already spent 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left. She has 6 miles left. So 6 miles in 1 hour is 6 mph. So yes, that's the answer. I think that's correct.

I need to figure out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters after mixing the orange drink and pineapple drink, considering I spilled one liter of the orange drink. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink would be 10 liters multiplied by 2/3. Let me calculate that: 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 ≈ 6.666... liters of water. And the rest is probably orange juice, which would be 10 - 20/3 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333... liters. But maybe I don't need the orange juice part, just the water.\n\nThen there's the pineapple drink, which is 15 liters, and three-fifths of that is water. So, water in pineapple drink is 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters. The rest is pineapple juice, which would be 15 - 9 = 6 liters. Again, maybe I don't need the pineapple juice part.\n\nBut wait, the problem says I'm adding the orange drink to the pineapple drink. However, I spilled one liter of the orange drink during the process. So, the total volume after adding would be... Let me think. Originally, I have 10 liters of orange drink, but I spilled 1 liter, so I have 9 liters left. Then I add that to the 15 liters of pineapple drink. So total volume would be 9 + 15 = 24 liters, which matches the question's mention of \"verbleibenden 24 Litern\" (remaining 24 liters). So that checks out.\n\nSo, the total water would be the water from the remaining orange drink plus the water from the pineapple drink. The spilled liter of orange drink was part of the original 10 liters, so I need to subtract the water from that spilled liter. Wait, but the question says I spilled one liter of the orange drink while pouring it into the pineapple drink. So, the spilled liter is not part of the final mixture. Therefore, the remaining orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters, and the water in that is 9 liters * (2/3) = 6 liters. Then the pineapple drink is 15 liters with 9 liters of water. So total water is 6 + 9 = 15 liters?\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original orange drink is 10 liters with 2/3 water. If I spill 1 liter of it, how much water is in that spilled liter? Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the spilled liter would contain 2/3 liters of water. Therefore, the remaining orange drink is 9 liters, which has 9 * (2/3) = 6 liters of water. Then the pineapple drink is 15 liters with 3/5 water, which is 9 liters. So total water is 6 + 9 = 15 liters. Therefore, the answer is 15 liters?\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"verbleibenden 24 Litern\" which is the remaining 24 liters after the spill. So the total volume is 24 liters, which is 9 liters of orange drink (after spill) plus 15 liters of pineapple drink. So yes, that's 24 liters. The water is 6 liters from orange and 9 liters from pineapple, totaling 15 liters. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I need to check if the spilled liter is considered as part of the original 10 liters. So, the original orange drink has 10 liters, 2/3 water. If I spill 1 liter, which is 2/3 water, then the remaining orange drink is 9 liters with 2/3 water. So 9*(2/3) = 6 liters. Then pineapple is 15 liters with 3/5 water, which is 9 liters. So total water is 6 + 9 = 15 liters. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the total water in the original orange drink before spill: 10*(2/3) = 20/3 ≈ 6.666 liters. Then subtract the water spilled: 2/3 liters. So 20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 = 6 liters. Then add pineapple's 9 liters. Total 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

The problem is about Raymond and Samantha being cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son when he was 23. Now Samantha is 31. The question is, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is 31 now and Raymond was born 6 years before her, that means Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. So if Samantha is 31, Raymond would be 31 + 6 = 37 years old now.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, then when Samantha was born, Raymond was already 6 years old. So yes, Raymond is 6 years older. So Samantha's age is 31, so Raymond's age is 31 + 6 = 37. That makes sense.\n\nNow, Raymond had a son when he was 23. So the son's age would be Raymond's current age minus 23. So 37 - 23 = 14. That means the son is 14 years old now. Therefore, the son was born 14 years ago.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Samantha is currently 31.\n2. Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so 31 + 6 = 37. Raymond is 37 now.\n3. Raymond had a son when he was 23. So the time between when Raymond had the son and now is 37 - 23 = 14 years. Therefore, the son was born 14 years ago.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should check if there's another way to approach it. For example, if we consider the time when Samantha was born. Since Raymond was 6 years old when Samantha was born, and Samantha is now 31, that means 31 years have passed since Samantha was born. So Raymond's age when Samantha was born was 6, and now he's 6 + 31 = 37, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThen, Raymond had a son when he was 23. So how many years ago was that? If Raymond is 37 now, then 37 - 23 = 14 years ago. So the son was born 14 years ago. That seems consistent.\n\nI don't see any other factors here. The problem doesn't mention any other events or time shifts. So the answer should be 14 years ago.\n</think>\n\nRaymond ist 6 Jahre älter als Samantha. Da Samantha jetzt 31 Jahre alt ist, ist Raymond $31 + 6 = 37$ Jahre alt. Raymond hatte seinen Sohn, als er 23 Jahre alt war.

Kyle bought a bestseller for $19.50, which was 25% off the original price. I need to find the original price. Hmm, so if there's a 25% discount, that means he paid 75% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 25% is 75%. So, $19.50 is 75% of the original price. \n\nWait, how do I convert that into an equation? Let me think. If the original price is, let's say, P dollars, then 75% of P is equal to $19.50. So, 0.75 * P = 19.50. To find P, I need to divide both sides by 0.75. That makes sense. So P = 19.50 / 0.75. Let me do that calculation. \n\nDividing 19.50 by 0.75. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this. 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 19.50 * (4/3).

Let me do that. 16.50 times 3. Well, 16 times 3 is 48, and 0.50 times 3 is 1.50, so adding those together gives 49.50 dollars for the shorts.\n\nNext, the pants. Each pair of pants is $22.50, and there are 3 of them. So 22.50 times 3. Let me calculate that. 20 times 3 is 60, and 2.50 times 3 is 7.50. Adding those gives 67.50 dollars for the pants.\n\nThen the shoes. Each pair is $42, and there are 3 pairs. So 42 times 3.

Cynthia eats a portion of ice cream every night. She buys cartons that have 15 portions each, and each carton costs $4.00. The question is, how much does she spend on ice cream after 60 days?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many portions she eats in 60 days. Since she eats one portion each night, that's straightforward. 60 days times 1 portion per day equals 60 portions total.\n\nNow, each carton has 15 portions. So, how many cartons does she need to buy to get 60 portions? I think I need to divide the total portions by the number of portions per carton. So 60 divided by 15. Let me do that calculation: 60 ÷ 15 = 4. So she needs 4 cartons.\n\nEach carton costs $4.00, so multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton should give the total cost. That would be 4 cartons times $4.00 per carton. 4 times 4 is 16. So, $16.00 total.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any possibility she might need an extra carton if the portions don't divide evenly. For example, if she needed 61 portions, she would need 5 cartons because 4 cartons would only give 60 portions. But in this case, 60 divided by 15 is exactly 4, so no extra carton is needed. So the calculation seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: per day, she uses 1 portion. Each carton lasts 15 days. So in 60 days, how many cartons? 60 days divided by 15 days per carton equals 4 cartons. Same result. Then 4 times $4 is $16. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here. The problem seems straightforward. Maybe I should confirm the units again. The cost is per carton, and each carton has 15 portions. So the total cost is based on the number of cartons needed, not per portion. So yes, 4 cartons at $4 each is $16. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nCynthia isst täglich eine Portion Eiscreme.

Then, the second stop is 15 miles before the end. So, the end is 60 miles. If the second stop is 15 miles before the end, that means he stopped at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Gloria is trying to decide between boots and two pairs of high heels. The problem says that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of high heels is $33, and the other is twice as much. So I need to figure out how much the boots cost.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information. The high heels: one is $33, the other is double that. So the second pair would be 2 times $33, which is $66. Then, the total cost for both high heels would be $33 plus $66. Let me add those up: 33 + 66 equals 99. So together, the two high heels cost $99.\n\nNow, the problem states that the high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. That means the boots cost $5 more than the total of the high heels. Since the high heels are $99, adding $5 to that would give the price of the boots. So $99 + $5 is $104. Therefore, the boots should cost $104.\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The first high heel is $33, the second is double, so 33*2=66. Total high heels: 33+66=99.

The problem says that the age ratio of Darrell and Allen is 7:11, and together they are 162 years old. I need to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the ratio of their ages is 7:11. That means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11 years. So, if I let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is some common multiplier. That makes sense because ratios can be represented as multiples of a common factor.\n\nNow, their combined ages are 162. So, adding their ages together: 7x + 11x = 162. Let me check that. Yes, combining like terms, that would be 18x = 162. Then, solving for x, I divide both sides by 18. So, x = 162 / 18. Let me calculate that. 18 times 9 is 162, right? 18*9=162. So x is 9.\n\nOkay, so Darrell's current age is 7x, which is 7*9 = 63 years old. And Allen's current age is 11x, which is 11*9 = 99 years old. Wait, that seems a bit old for Allen, but maybe it's possible. Let me verify the total. 63 + 99 = 162. Yes, that adds up correctly.\n\nNow, the question asks how old Allen will be in 10 years. So, Allen is currently 99, so in 10 years, he'll be 99 + 10 = 109 years old. Hmm, that seems really old, but mathematically, it checks out. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the ratio part.\n\nThe ratio 7:11, so 7 parts to 11 parts. Total parts are 18. 162 divided by 18 is indeed 9. So each part is 9 years. Therefore, Darrell is 7*9=63, Allen is 11*9=99. Adding them gives 162. Then adding 10 years to Allen's age gives 109. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of the ratio. Is it possible that the ratio is reversed? Like, maybe Darrell is older than Allen? But the ratio is given as Darrell to Allen as 7:11, so Darrell is younger. So 7:11, Darrell is 7 parts, Allen is 11 parts. So the math is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the question is asking for Allen's age in 10 years, which is 99 +10=109. That seems correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So the answer should be 109.\n</think>\n\nDas Altersverhältnis von Darrell und Allen beträgt 7:11. Sei $ x $ der gemeinsame Faktor. Dann sind Darrells Alter $ 7x $ und Allens Alter $ 11x $.

Let me note that down: Friend 1 = 80.\n\nThe second friend says 20 more than half of the first estimate. Hmm, okay. So half of the first estimate is half of 80. Half of 80 is 40. Then adding 20 to that would be 40 + 20 = 60. So Friend 2's estimate is 60. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. The second friend says \"20 more than the half of the first estimation.\" So yes, half of 80 is 40, plus 20 is 60. That seems correct.\n\nThird friend says 25% more than the first one. The first one is 80. 25% of 80 is... 25% is a quarter, so 80 divided by 4 is 20. So 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100. Therefore, Friend 3's estimate is 100. Let me confirm that. 25% of 80 is indeed 20, so adding that gives 100. Yep.\n\nNow, to find the average of the three estimates. The formula for average is (sum of all estimates) divided by the number of estimates. So, adding up Friend 1, Friend 2, and Friend 3: 80 + 60 + 100. Let's calculate that. 80 + 60 is 140, and 140 + 100 is 240. Then divide by 3. 240 divided by 3 is 80. Wait, that's interesting. The average is 80? But Friend 1 and Friend 3 are 80 and 100, and Friend 2 is 60. So 80, 60, 100. The average is (80 + 60 + 100)/3 = 240/3 = 80. So the average is 80. That seems a bit surprising because Friend 3's estimate is higher, but Friend 2's is lower, balancing it out. Let me check the calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst friend: 80. Second: half of 80 is 40, plus 20 is 60. Third: 25% more than 80 is 80 * 1.25 = 100. Sum: 80 + 60 = 140, 140 + 100 = 240. 240 divided by 3 is indeed 80. So the average is 80. That seems correct.

Then, since there are 30 more gold coins than silver, the number of gold coins would be S + 30. Right? Because gold is 30 more than silver.\n\nNow, the total number of coins is 110.

So, half of Raymond's would be 40 divided by 2, which is 20. Then Aaron has 5 more than that, so 20 + 5 = 25. So Aaron has 25 pieces.\n\nNow, Siobhan has 2 fewer than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25, subtract 2 from that. 25 - 2 = 23. So Siobhan should have 23 pieces. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers.\n\nRaymond: 40. Half of that is 20. Aaron has 5 more than 20, which is 25. Siobhan has 2 less than Aaron, so 25 - 2 = 23. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to first find Aaron's amount based on Raymond's, then use that to find Siobhan's. All the steps make sense. So the answer should be 23.\n</think>\n\nRaymond hat 40 Schmuckstücke. Aaron hat 5 mehr als die Hälfte von Raymonds Schmuckstücken:  \n$$\n\\frac{40}{2} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25\n$$  \nSiobhan hat 2 weniger als Aaron:  \n$$\n25 - 2 = 23\n$$  \n\n**Antwort:** Siobhan besitzt 23 Schmuckstücke."]], "filtered_resps": ["23"], "doc_hash": "4e46756472355db63453c6d9817012c1785650c62a52bb5c15670557a528c45b", "prompt_hash": "aef1e4e287c875a9b0e67b4606208d68ca5c1bb7780b0fdfba3fee6310ca3950", "target_hash": "535fa30d7e25dd8a49f1536779734ec8286108d115da5045d77f3b4185d8f790", "exact_match": 1.0}

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes total. The first 20 minutes he makes 4 points. Then in the next 20 minutes, he makes 25% more points than before. I need to find the total points he made.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many points he made in the second 20 minutes. The problem says it's 25% more than the first 20 minutes. So, the first part is 4 points. 25% of 4 is... let me calculate that. 25% is the same as 0.25, so 4 * 0.25 = 1. So, 25% more would be adding 1 point to the original 4. That makes 5 points in the second 20 minutes?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check that again. If he makes 25% more points, does that mean 25% of the original number? So, 4 points plus 25% of 4 points. Yes, that's 4 + 1 = 5. So, 5 points in the second 20 minutes.\n\nThen, total points would be 4 + 5 = 9 points. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The question says \"25 % Punkte mehr.\" In German, \"mehr\" means more, so it's 25% more than the original amount. So, yes, 25% of 4 is 1, so 5 points in the second half. Total of 9 points. That seems right.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different way to interpret it? Like, maybe the rate of points per minute? But the problem says \"in den ersten 20 Minuten macht er 4 Punkte\" and then \"in den darauffolgenden 20 Minuten macht er 25 % Punkte mehr.\" So, it's not about the rate, but the total points. So, the first 20 minutes: 4 points. The next 20 minutes: 25% more than 4 points. So, 4 * 1.25 = 5. So, 4 + 5 = 9. Yeah, that's the same as before.\n\nI think that's correct. Maybe I can check with another approach. If 25% more points, then the second part is 1.25 times the first part. 4 * 1.25 = 5. Total is 4 + 5 = 9. Yep, same answer.

But maybe the problem is in German, and \"seine gesamtes Spielzeug\" might not be all his toys, but maybe he has other toys too? Wait, the problem says \"Er hat 13 Lego-Sets und verkauft sie...\" So he has 13 Lego sets and sells them. So he sells all 13. Then the answer would be zero. But that seems too easy. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he didn't sell all of them? Wait, the problem says \"sein gesamtes Spielzeug zu verkaufen\" which is \"to sell all his toys\". But he has 13 Lego sets, which are part of his toys. So he sells all his toys, which includes the 13 Lego sets. Therefore, he has none left. But then why mention the video games and the money? Maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is zero, but maybe there's a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let me check the math. Let's see:\n\nTotal money from selling Lego sets: 13 * $15 = $195.\n\nHe buys 8 video games at $20 each: 8 * $20 = $160.\n\nHe has $5 left. So total money he had was $160 + $5 = $165.\n\nBut he got $195 from selling the Lego sets. So he has $195 - $165 = $30 left? Wait, but the problem says he has $5 left after buying the video games. So maybe the $5 is after buying the video games. So the total money he had was $160 + $5 = $165. But he sold the Lego sets for $195. So he has $195 - $165 = $30 left? But the problem says he has $5 left. Wait, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check again. Let me rephrase:\n\nHe sells all 13 Lego sets for $15 each: 13 * 15 = $195.\n\nHe uses this money to buy 8 video games at $20 each: 8 * 20 = $160.\n\nHe has $5 left. So total money he had was $160 + $5 = $165. But he sold the Lego sets for $195. So where is the discrepancy? $195 - $165 = $30. So he should have $30 left, but the problem says he has $5 left. That doesn't add up. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, maybe he didn't sell all his Lego sets. Maybe he sold some and kept some. But the problem says \"Er hat 13 Lego-Sets und verkauft sie...\" which translates to \"He has 13 Lego sets and sells them...\" So \"sie\" refers to the 13 Lego sets. So he sells all 13. But then the math doesn't add up. Let me check again:\n\nTotal from selling Lego: 13 * 15 = 195.\n\nTotal spent on video games: 8 * 20 = 160.\n\nLeftover: 5.\n\nSo total money he had was 160 + 5 = 165. But he sold the Lego for 195. So he should have 195 - 165 = 30 left. But the problem says he has 5 left. That's a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem or my interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that he didn't sell all the Lego sets. Maybe he sold some and kept some. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me assume that he sold x Lego sets, and kept (13 - x) sets. Then the money from selling is 15x. He uses that money to buy 8 video games for 20 each, so 160, and has 5 left. So total money he had is 160 + 5 = 165. Therefore, 15x = 165. So x = 11. Therefore, he sold 11 Lego sets and kept 13 - 11 = 2. So the answer would be 2.\n\nBut the problem says \"Er hat 13 Lego-Sets und verkauft sie...\" which is \"He has 13 Lego sets and sells them...\" So \"sie\" refers to the 13 sets. So he sells all of them. But that leads to inconsistency in the math. Therefore, maybe the original problem has a typo, or the translation is slightly off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in German and \"verkauft sie\" might not mean all of them. Maybe \"sie\" refers to some of them, but the translation is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is zero, but the math doesn't add up. Let me check again:\n\nIf he sells all 13 Lego sets for 15 each: 13*15=195.\n\nBuys 8 games for 20 each: 8*20=160.\n\nLeft with 5. So total money he had was 160 +5=165. But he sold the Lego for 195. So he should have 195 - 165 = 30 left. But the problem says he has 5 left. Therefore, there's a discrepancy of 25. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the 5 dollars is after buying the video games, but he also had some money before selling the Lego sets. But the problem doesn't mention that. It says he sells all his toys (the Lego sets) and uses the money to buy video games. So he starts with zero money, sells the Lego for 195, buys games for 160, and has 5 left. But 195 - 160 = 35, not 5. So that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's numbers, or perhaps the translation is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking how many Lego sets he has left after selling some, but the translation is off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in German and \"verkauft sie\" refers to selling some of them, not all. If that's the case, then solving for x:\n\n15x = 8*20 +5 = 165 → x=11. So he sold 11, kept 2. Therefore, answer is 2.\n\nBut the original problem says \"Er hat 13 Lego-Sets und verkauft sie...\" which would mean \"He has 13 Lego sets and sells them...\" implying all of them. But if that's the case, the math doesn't add up. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is 2, assuming that he didn't sell all of them, and the problem has a translation error or typo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is zero, but the numbers are wrong. However, since the user is asking for the answer, and given that in the calculation if we assume he sold 11, then the answer is 2, which makes the math work, I think that's the intended solution. Therefore, the answer is 2 Lego sets left.\n</think>\n\nJohn verkauft 13 Lego-Sets zu je 15 USD, was insgesamt **195 USD** einbringt.

The problem is about Dana's different speeds when running, walking, and hopping. I need to figure out how many miles she can cover in six hours if she spends a third of the time running and two-thirds walking. But first, there's some information about her hopping speed. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk. So, if I let her walking speed be some value, then her running speed is four times that. But then it also mentions that she can only hop at half her running speed. And they tell us that her hopping speed is 3 miles per hour. So maybe I can use that to find her running speed first?\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n- Hopping speed = 3 mph\n- Hopping speed = ½ × Running speed\n- Therefore, Running speed = 2 × Hopping speed = 2 × 3 = 6 mph\n- Running speed is 4 times walking speed, so Walking speed = Running speed / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 mph\n\nOkay, so her walking speed is 1.5 mph, running is 6 mph, and hopping is 3 mph. But the question is about her running and walking, not hopping. Wait, the problem says she spends a third of the time running and two-thirds walking. So hopping is mentioned here, but maybe that's just to find her running speed? Because they didn't directly give her running speed, but gave her hopping speed instead. So that's how we get the running speed.\n\nNow, the total time is six hours. She spends 1/3 of that time running and 2/3 walking. Let me calculate the time spent on each activity.\n\nTime running = (1/3) × 6 hours = 2 hours\nTime walking = (2/3) × 6 hours = 4 hours\n\nSo she runs for 2 hours at 6 mph and walks for 4 hours at 1.5 mph. Then the total distance would be the sum of the distances from each activity.\n\nDistance running = speed × time = 6 mph × 2 h = 12 miles\nDistance walking = 1.5 mph × 4 h = 6 miles\n\nTotal distance = 12 + 6 = 18 miles\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if I missed anything. The problem mentions hopping, but the question is about running and walking. The hopping part was just to find her running speed, right? Because they said she can hop at half her running speed, and that's 3 mph. So that gives us the running speed. Then the rest is just calculating the distances based on the given time fractions. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations:\n\nRunning speed: 2 × 3 = 6 mph. Correct.\n\nWalking speed: 6 / 4 = 1.5 mph. Correct.\n\nTime running: 6 × 1/3 = 2 hours. Correct.\n\nTime walking: 6 × 2/3 = 4 hours. Correct.\n\nDistance running: 6 × 2 = 12. Correct.\n\nDistance walking: 1.5 × 4 = 6. Correct.\n\nTotal: 12 + 6 = 18. Yeah, that seems to add up. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The hopping part was just a way to find her running speed, which is necessary because they didn't give it directly. So the answer should be 18 miles.\n</think>\n\nDana's Geschwindigkeiten können wie folgt berechnet werden:\n\n1. **Hüpfgeschwindigkeit**: Gegeben als 3 Meilen pro Stunde.\n2. **Laufgeschwindigkeit**: Die Hüpfgeschwindigkeit ist halb so groß wie die Laufgeschwindigkeit.  \n   $$\n   \\text{Laufgeschwindigkeit} = 2 \\times \\text{Hüpfgeschwindigkeit} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\, \\text{mph}\n   $$\n3. **Gehgeschwindigkeit**: Die Laufgeschwindigkeit ist viermal so groß wie die Gehgeschwindigkeit.  \n   $$\n   \\text{Gehgeschwindigkeit} = \\frac{\\text{Laufgeschwindigkeit}}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1{,}5 \\, \\text{mph}\n   $$\n\n**Zeitverteilung**:\n- **Laufen**: $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 \\, \\text{Stunden} = 2 \\, \\text{Stunden}$\n- **Gehen**: $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 \\, \\text{Stunden} = 4 \\, \\text{Stunden}$\n\n**Gesamtstrecke**:\n- **Laufen**: $6 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 2 \\, \\text{h} = 12 \\, \\text{Meilen}$\n- **Gehen**: $1{,}5 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 4 \\, \\text{h} = 6 \\, \\text{Meilen}$\n\n$$\n\\text{Gesamtstrecke} = 12 + 6 = \\boxed{18} \\, \\text{Meilen}\n$$\n\n**Antwort:** Dana kann innerhalb von sechs Stunden **18 Meilen** zurücklegen."]], "filtered_resps": ["18"], "doc_hash": "725a911d5c20ffbe4166de269e7edf8b44b4b5dc654356157fd27aac617ea58a", "prompt_hash": "18122453bd998fdd3ef869387956e29eb5649b8363bed795d3b1e45fa0039404", "target_hash": "4ec9599fc203d176a301536c2e091a19bc852759b255bd6818810a42c5fed14a", "exact_match": 1.0}

The problem is about figuring out how old Brandon's iPhone is based on the ages of Ben's and Suzzy's iPhones. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that Suzzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Then, Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzzy's. So if Suzzy's is 1 year, Ben's would be 2 times that. Let me write that down: Ben's age = 2 * Suzzy's age. Since Suzzy's is 1, Ben's is 2 * 1 = 2 years old. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, it says Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's.

Suzzy is 1, Ben is twice that, so 2. Then Brandon is four times Ben's age, which is 4*2=8. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here.

So the problem is about Polly and the dragon Perg. The dragon is on a mountain and can breathe fire up to 1000 feet around him. Polly has a golden spear that she can throw, but without the sapphire gem, she can only throw it 400 feet. But when she holds the sapphire, she can throw it three times as far. The question is, if she holds the sapphire, how far outside the dragon's fire range can she stand and still hit the dragon with the spear?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, without the sapphire, her throw is 400 feet. But with the sapphire, it's three times that, so 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. The dragon's fire range is 1000 feet. So normally, without the sapphire, she can't reach the dragon because 400 is less than 1000. But with the sapphire, she can throw it 1200 feet. The question is, how much further beyond the 1000 feet can she stand and still hit the dragon?\n\nWait, so if the dragon's fire is a circle with a radius of 1000 feet, then anything within that circle is in the fire. So Polly needs to be outside that circle but still within the range of her spear. So the maximum distance she can be from the dragon and still hit him is 1200 feet. But the dragon's fire only reaches 1000 feet. So the difference between her maximum throw distance and the dragon's fire range is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet. Therefore, she can stand 200 feet outside the fire range and still hit the dragon.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If the dragon is at the center, and the fire is a circle of radius 1000 feet. If Polly is standing at a distance of 1000 feet, that's exactly on the edge of the fire. If she can throw the spear 1200 feet, then she can stand up to 1200 feet away from the dragon and hit him. So the distance beyond the fire range would be 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet. So she can be 200 feet outside the fire's reach and still hit the dragon. That seems right.\n\nBut maybe I need to visualize it. Imagine the dragon is at point D, and Polly is at point P. The fire range is a circle with radius 1000 feet around D. If Polly is outside this circle, she's safe from the fire. But she can throw the spear up to 1200 feet. So the maximum distance between D and P where she can still hit the dragon is 1200 feet. Therefore, the distance from the edge of the fire (which is 1000 feet from D) to the point where she can stand and still hit the dragon is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet. So she can be 200 feet beyond the fire's reach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"how far outside the fire range can she stand and still hit the dragon?\" So if the fire range is up to 1000 feet, then standing at 1000 feet is the edge. To be outside, she needs to be more than 1000 feet away. But she can throw the spear up to 1200 feet. So the maximum distance she can be from the dragon and still hit him is 1200 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the fire range is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet. So she can be 200 feet outside the fire range and still hit the dragon.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

The question is, how many pieces did the guests take?\n\nAlright, first, I need to figure out the total number of pieces that were available at the beginning.

The question is about how many grams of chips I can eat without exceeding my daily calorie goal. So, the information given is that a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, and a 300g bag contains 5 servings. I've already eaten 1800 calories today, and my goal is 2000. So I need to figure out how many grams of chips I can eat to stay within the remaining 200 calories.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many calories are in one serving. Wait, the problem says each serving is 250 calories. But the bag is 300g and has 5 servings. So each serving is 300g divided by 5, which is 60g per serving. That makes sense. So each serving is 60g and 250 calories.\n\nNow, I have 200 calories left. So how many servings can I have? If each serving is 250 calories, but I can only have 200, that's less than one serving. Wait, but maybe I need to calculate the exact amount. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should find out the calorie per gram first. If 60g is 250 calories, then per gram it's 250 divided by 60. Let me calculate that. 250 divided by 60 is approximately 4.1667 calories per gram. So each gram of chips has about 4.1667 calories.\n\nBut I need to find out how many grams I can eat with 200 calories. So if 1 gram is 4.1667 calories, then 200 calories would be 200 divided by 4.1667. Let me do that division. 200 divided by 4.1667 is approximately 48 grams. Wait, because 4.1667 times 48 is 200. Let me check that. 4.1667 * 48 = 200. Yes, because 4.1667 is 25/6, so 25/6 * 48 = 25 * 8 = 200. Exactly. So that's 48 grams.\n\nAlternatively, since each serving is 60g for 250 calories, then 200 calories would be (200/250) * 60g. That's 0.8 * 60 = 48 grams. That's another way to calculate it. So either way, the answer is 48 grams.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The total calories allowed are 200. Each serving is 250 calories, which is more than 200. So I can't have a full serving. So 200 calories is 200/250 = 0.8 of a serving. Since each serving is 60g, 0.8 * 60 = 48g. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 48 grams.\n</think>\n\nUm zu berechnen, wie viele Gramm Chips du essen darfst, ohne dein tägliches Kalorienziel zu überschreiten, folge diesen Schritten:\n\n1. **Kalorien pro Portion:**  \n   Die Tüte enthält 5 Portionen mit jeweils **250 Kalorien**.  \n   → **250 Kalorien/Portion**.\n\n2. **Gramm pro Portion:**  \n   Die Tüte wiegt **300 g** und enthält **5 Portionen**.  \n   → **300 g ÷ 5 = 60 g/Portion**.\n\n3. **Verfügbare Kalorien:**  \n   Dein tägliches Ziel ist **2000 Kalorien**, du hast bereits **1800 Kalorien** gegessen.  \n   → **2000 - 1800 = 200 Kalorien** übrig.\n\n4. **Berechnung der zulässigen Menge:**  \n   - **Kalorien pro Gramm:**  \n     $ \\frac{250\\ \\text{Kalorien}}{60\\ \\text{g}} \\approx 4.1667\\ \\text{Kalorien/g} $.  \n   - **Gramm für 200 Kalorien:**  \n     $ \\frac{200\\ \\text{Kalorien}}{4.1667\\ \\text{Kalorien/g}} \\approx 48\\ \\text{g} $.  \n\n   Alternativ:  \n   - **Anteil der Portion:**  \n     $ \\frac{200\\ \\text{Kalorien}}{250\\ \\text{Kalorien/Portion}} = 0.8\\ \\text{Portionen} $.  \n   - **Gramm für 0.8 Portionen:**  \n     $ 0.8 \\times 60\\ \\text{g} = 48\\ \\text{g} $.\n\n**Antwort:** Du darfst **48 Gramm** Chips essen."]], "filtered_resps": ["48"], "doc_hash": "04a43946fc47cef016a15d95eaee626dcb34bc0eda29a9ab188f465ca0e48c4b", "prompt_hash": "e15028a7aa50938f65320246fe74bc3cfdf6f0f1ccc2419dd6992783279f260c", "target_hash": "98010bd9270f9b100b6214a21754fd33bdc8d41b2bc9f9dd16ff54d3c34ffd71", "exact_match": 1.0}

Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. The question is about calculating his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that from each pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles. So, if he makes 20 candles, how many pounds of beeswax does he need? Well, if 10 candles come from 1 pound, then 20 candles would need 2 pounds of beeswax. That makes sense because 20 divided by 10 is 2. So, 2 pounds of beeswax required.\n\nNext, the cost of the materials. The problem states that the materials (which includes the beeswax and the wicks) cost $10.00 per pound of beeswax. Wait, is that per pound or per candle? Let me check again. It says, \"Das Zubehör aus einem Pfund Bienenwachs plus Dochte kostet 10,00 US-Dollar.\" Translating that, it's \"The accessories from one pound of beeswax plus wicks cost $10.00.\" So, the total cost for one pound of beeswax plus wicks is $10.00. So, that's the cost per pound. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost would be 2 times $10.00, which is $20.00. So, the total cost for materials is $20.00.\n\nNow, the selling price. Each candle is sold for $2.00. If he sells 20 candles, then the total revenue is 20 times $2.00, which is $40.00.\n\nTo find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. So, $40.00 (revenue) minus $20.00 (cost) equals $20.00. Therefore, his net profit is $20.00.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"Zubehör aus einem Pfund Bienenwachs plus Dochte kostet 10,00 US-Dollar.\" So, does that mean that the cost for the materials (beeswax and wicks) is $10 per pound? So, for each pound of beeswax, the cost is $10. So, if he uses 2 pounds, that's 2 * $10 = $20. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that the $10 is the cost for the wicks and other accessories, and the beeswax is separate? But the wording says \"Zubehör aus einem Pfund Bienenwachs plus Dochte kostet 10,00 US-Dollar.\" So, \"accessories from one pound of beeswax plus wicks cost $10.\" That seems like the total cost for the materials needed to make the candles from one pound of beeswax, including the wicks. So, the $10 is the total cost for the beeswax and the wicks for one pound. Therefore, for two pounds, it's $20. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total revenue is 20 candles * $2 = $40. Total cost is $20. Profit is $40 - $20 = $20. So, the answer should be $20.00.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just make sure there's no trick here.

Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes health articles. The problem is asking for the total number of hours she spent writing articles over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many articles she wrote each day. Then multiply that by 4 hours per article to get the total hours for each day, and then add them all up.\n\nStarting with Monday: She wrote 5 articles. That's straightforward. So Monday's hours would be 5 articles * 4 hours = 20 hours. Got that.\n\nNext, Tuesday: She wrote 2/5 more articles than on Monday. Hmm, okay. So 2/5 more than Monday's 5 articles. Let me calculate that. 2/5 of 5 is (2/5)*5 = 2. So she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday? Wait, is that right? Because 2/5 more than Monday's amount. So if Monday is 5, then 2/5 of 5 is 2, so adding that to 5 gives 7. Yeah, that seems correct. So Tuesday's articles: 7. Then hours would be 7 * 4 = 28 hours.\n\nThen Wednesday: She wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday. So Tuesday was 7, so Wednesday is 2*7 = 14 articles. Then hours would be 14 * 4 = 56 hours.\n\nNow, adding up all the hours: Monday (20) + Tuesday (28) + Wednesday (56) = 20 + 28 is 48, plus 56 is 104 hours total. \n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake with the fractions. Let me verify the Tuesday calculation again. The problem says \"2/5 mehr Artikel als am Montag.\" So \"2/5 more\" than Monday. So if Monday is 5, then 2/5 of 5 is 2, so 5 + 2 = 7. That's correct. So Tuesday is 7 articles. Then Wednesday is twice that, so 14. \n\nTotal articles over three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles. Multiply by 4 hours each: 26 * 4 = 104 hours. Yep, that matches.

So the problem is about Candice and her Post-it notes. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, Candice starts with 80 Post-it notes in her purse before she leaves for work. Then, she makes a stop at a store and buys another pack of Post-it notes. At work, she uses 220 Post-it notes, one on each of 220 different coffee cups. After all that, she has 23 Post-it notes left. The question is asking how many Post-it notes were in the pack she bought at the store.\n\nAlright, so let me think. The total number of Post-it notes she has after buying the pack would be her original 80 plus the number she bought. Then she uses 220 of them, and ends up with 23 left. So maybe I can set up an equation here.\n\nLet me denote the number of Post-its in the pack she bought as x. So initially, she has 80 + x Post-its. Then she uses 220, so the remaining would be (80 + x) - 220. And this equals 23. So the equation is:\n\n80 + x - 220 = 23\n\nSimplifying that, 80 - 220 is -140, so:\n\nx - 140 = 23\n\nThen, solving for x, we add 140 to both sides:\n\nx = 23 + 140 = 163\n\nWait, so the pack she bought had 163 Post-it notes? Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nStarting with 80, buying 163, so total is 80 + 163 = 243. Then she uses 220, so 243 - 220 = 23. Yes, that matches the remaining 23. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says she had 80 in her purse before leaving, then bought a pack. So the total before using any is 80 + x. Then she uses 220, and has 23 left. So yes, the equation is correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it: the total number of Post-its she had available is the original 80 plus the pack she bought. She used 220, so the total used plus the remaining should equal the total she had. So:\n\nTotal used + remaining = total available\n\n220 + 23 = 80 + x\n\n243 = 80 + x\n\nx = 243 - 80 = 163\n\nSame result. So that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the answer should be 163.\n</think>\n\nCandice begann mit 80 Post-it-Notizzetteln und kaufte eine Packung mit $ x $ Notizzetteln. Insgesamt hatte sie also $ 80 + x $ Notizzettel.

Since each blue tie is $40 and he spent $200, I can divide 200 by 40 to get the number of blue ties. Let me check that: 200 divided by 40 is 5. So he bought 5 blue ties.\n\nNow, he buys twice as many red ties as blue ones. So if he has 5 blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times that, which is 10 red ties. Got that part.\n\nNext, the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ones. The blue ones are $40 each, so 50% of 40 is 20. Therefore, the red ties cost 40 + 20 = $60 each. Let me confirm that: 50% more means 1.5 times the original price. 40 * 1.5 = 60. Yep, that's right.\n\nNow, to find out how much he spent on red ties, multiply the number of red ties by their price.

Uriah has a backpack that's too heavy, and he needs to remove 15 pounds. He has comic books and toys in there. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and each toy is 1/2 pound. He takes out 30 comic books, and now we need to figure out how many toys he has to remove to get the total weight down by 15 pounds.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate how much weight the 30 comic books contribute. Since each comic is 1/4 pound, multiplying 30 by 1/4 should give the total weight from the comics. Let me do that: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. So, removing 30 comics takes care of 7.5 pounds.\n\nNow, the total weight he needs to remove is 15 pounds. If he's already removed 7.5 pounds with the comics, then the remaining weight to remove is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. That's the part that needs to come from the toys.\n\nEach toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to get 7.5 pounds, I can divide the remaining weight by the weight per toy. So, 7.5 divided by 0.5. Hmm, 7.5 divided by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2, right? So 7.5 * 2 = 15. Therefore, he needs to remove 15 toys.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If each toy is 0.5 pounds, then 15 toys would be 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 pounds. Yes, that matches the remaining weight. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything. Total weight to remove: 15 lbs. Comic books removed: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 lbs. Remaining weight: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 lbs. Number of toys needed: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI think that's it.

The problem is about a mechanic who charges different rates for repairing truck tires and car tires. I need to figure out which day, Thursday or Friday, had a higher revenue and then state that amount. \n\nFirst, let me parse the information given. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. For each truck tire, he charges $60, and for each car tire, $40. Then on Friday, he repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. So, I need to calculate the total revenue for each day and compare them.\n\nStarting with Thursday. The revenue from truck tires would be the number of truck tires times the rate per truck tire. That's 6 truck tires multiplied by $60 each. Let me calculate that: 6 * 60. Hmm, 6*60 is 360. Then, the car tires on Thursday are 4, each at $40. So 4 * 40. That's 160. Adding those together, 360 + 160. Let me add those numbers. 360 + 160 is 520. So Thursday's total revenue is $520.\n\nNow for Friday. He didn't repair any truck tires, so that part is zero. He repaired 12 car tires at $40 each. So 12 * 40. Let me compute that. 12*40. Well, 10*40 is 400, and 2*40 is 80, so 400 + 80 = 480. So Friday's revenue is $480.\n\nComparing the two days: Thursday was $520 and Friday was $480. Therefore, Thursday had the higher revenue. The question asks for the revenue on the day with the higher amount, which is Thursday's $520. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nThursday: 6 truck tires at $60. 6*60 is indeed 360. 4 car tires at $40: 4*40 is 160. 360 + 160 = 520. Correct. \n\nFriday: 12 car tires at $40. 12*40. 10*40=400, 2*40=80, total 480. Correct. \n\nSo yes, Thursday's revenue is higher. Therefore, the answer should be $520. \n\nI think that's all.

The question is asking how many kittens the Doubtfires have now.\n\nAlright, so first, let me break down the information. The sisters already have 7 adopted kittens. Then, their two housecats, Patchy and Trixie, have each given birth to some kittens. The total number of kittens they have now would be the original 7 plus the new ones from Patchy and Trixie.\n\nThe problem says Patchy has three times as many kittens as the adopted ones. Wait, the adopted ones are the 7 kittens they took from the shelter. So does that mean Patchy has 3 times 7? Let me check that again. The wording is: \"Patchy, the first cat, three times as many kittens as the adopted, while Trixie, the other cat 12 brought to the world.\" So yes, \"as the adopted\" refers to the 7 adopted kittens. So Patchy's kittens are 3 * 7 = 21. Then Trixie has 12. So total new kittens are 21 + 12 = 33. Then adding the original 7, that would be 7 + 33 = 40. So the total number of kittens they have now is 40?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret. The problem says \"die adoptierten, während Trixie... 12 zur Welt gebracht hat.\" So \"die adoptierten\" refers to the 7 kittens they adopted. So Patchy has three times as many as the adopted ones, which are 7. So 3*7=21. Then Trixie has 12. So total new kittens are 21+12=33. Then adding the original 7, total is 7+33=40. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, is there a chance that \"die adoptierten\" refers to the kittens that are now with them, including the new ones? No, because the problem says they adopted 7 kittens, and then their cats gave birth to new kittens. So the original 7 are separate from the new ones. So the answer should be 7 + 21 + 12 = 40.

I need to figure out how many boxes the truck can carry without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. The bridge can handle up to 5,000 pounds. The truck itself, including the driver, weighs 3,755 pounds when empty. Each box is 15 pounds. So, the total weight when the truck is loaded is the empty weight plus the weight of the boxes. I need to make sure that total doesn't go over 5,000 pounds.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how much weight is left for the boxes. That would be the bridge's limit minus the truck's empty weight. So 5,000 minus 3,755. Let me do that subtraction. 5,000 minus 3,755... Hmm, 5,000 minus 3,000 is 2,000, then minus 755 more. So 2,000 minus 755 is 1,245. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 3,755 plus 1,245 equals 5,000? Let's add them: 3,755 + 1,245. 3,000 + 1,000 is 4,000. 755 + 245 is 1,000. So total is 5,000. Yes, that's correct. So the available weight for the boxes is 1,245 pounds.\n\nNow, each box is 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes, I need to divide the available weight by the weight per box. So 1,245 divided by 15. Let me do that division. 15 times 80 is 1,200. Then 1,245 minus 1,200 is 45. 45 divided by 15 is 3. So that's 80 + 3 = 83 boxes. Wait, so 83 boxes would be 83 times 15. Let me check that. 80*15=1,200, 3*15=45, so total 1,245. Exactly. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"maximale Anzahl an Kisten\", so the maximum number of boxes without exceeding the limit. So 83 boxes would make the total weight exactly 5,000 pounds. But maybe the truck can't carry a fraction of a box, so 83 is the maximum whole number. Therefore, the answer is 83.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to be sure. The truck's empty weight is 3,755. Adding 83 boxes at 15 pounds each: 83*15=1,245. Total weight is 3,755 + 1,245 = 5,000. Perfect, that's exactly the limit. So 83 is the correct number. If they tried to add one more box, that would be 84 boxes. 84*15=1,260. Then total weight would be 3,755 + 1,260 = 5,015, which is over the limit.

Stephen ordered some groceries online, and the final bill was $40.00. But then there were some extra charges. The delivery was done by a delivery service, so they added a 25% fee on the final bill and also charged $3.00 for delivery. Plus, Stephen gave a $4.00 tip. The question is asking for the final price after all these extra charges.\n\nWait, first I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. The original total was $40.00. Then, the delivery service added a 25% fee on top of that, and also a $3.00 delivery fee. Then Stephen added a $4.00 tip. So, the total would be the original amount plus the 25% fee, plus the $3 delivery fee, plus the $4 tip?\n\nBut wait, the wording says \"they have added a 25% fee on the final bill and charged $3.00 delivery fee.\" Hmm, maybe the 25% is on the original $40, and then the $3 is separate? Or is the 25% fee on the final bill after adding the $3 delivery fee? The wording is a bit ambiguous here.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"Da die Lieferung von einem Lieferdienstleister getätigt wurde, haben sie auf die Endabrechnung eine Gebühr von 25 % aufgeschlagen und ihm 3,00 US-Dollar Liefergebühr berechnet.\" So, \"they added a 25% fee on the final bill and charged him $3.00 delivery fee.\" So, the 25% is on the original final bill (which was $40), and then they added $3.00 delivery fee. Then Stephen gave a $4 tip. So, the total would be original $40 + 25% of $40 + $3 + $4?\n\nWait, but the original final bill was $40. So, the 25% fee is on that $40. So 25% of 40 is 10. So that would be $10. Then the delivery fee is $3. Then the tip is $4. So total would be 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 57?\n\nBut maybe the 25% is on the final bill after adding the delivery fee? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me check the original German again: \"haben sie auf die Endabrechnung eine Gebühr von 25 % aufgeschlagen und ihm 3,00 US-Dollar Liefergebühr berechnet.\" So \"on the final bill, they added a 25% fee and charged him $3 delivery fee.\" So the 25% is on the original final bill (which was $40), and then the $3 is an additional fee. So the 25% is calculated on the original $40, then the $3 is added, then the tip.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 25% is on the total after adding the delivery fee? But the way it's phrased, \"auf die Endabrechnung\" which is \"on the final bill\" (the original $40). So the 25% is on the original $40, then the delivery fee is $3, then the tip is $4. So total would be 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 57.\n\nBut let me think again. If the original final bill was $40, and then they added a 25% fee on that, so 40 * 1.25 = 50. Then they also added $3 delivery fee, making it 50 + 3 = 53, and then the tip is $4, so total 57. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if the 25% is on the total after adding the delivery fee, but the problem says \"auf die Endabrechnung\" which was $40. So the 25% is on the original $40. So the steps are:\n\nOriginal total: $40\n\n25% fee: 40 * 0.25 = $10\n\nDelivery fee: $3\n\nTip: $4\n\nTotal: 40 + 10 + 3 + 4 = $57.\n\nYes, that seems to be the case. So the answer should be $57.00.\n</think>\n\nStephen's ursprüngliche Bestellung betrug 40,00 USD.

The question is about calculating the total number of raspberries on a bush. So, the problem states that there are 6 clusters (Trauben) with 20 fruits each, and also 67 individual fruits scattered on the bush. I need to find the total number of raspberries.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem into parts. The first part is the clusters. Each cluster has 20 fruits, and there are 6 clusters. So, to find the total number of fruits in the clusters, I need to multiply the number of clusters by the number of fruits per cluster. That would be 6 times 20. Let me do that calculation: 6 * 20 = 120. So, there are 120 fruits in the clusters.\n\nThen, there are 67 individual fruits. These are separate from the clusters, so I just need to add those to the total from the clusters. So, adding 120 (from the clusters) and 67 (individual fruits) together. Let me add those numbers: 120 + 67. Hmm, 120 plus 60 is 180, and then plus 7 more is 187. So, the total number of raspberries should be 187.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The clusters: 6 * 20 is definitely 120. Then 120 + 67. Breaking it down, 120 + 60 = 180, then 180 +7 = 187. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem mentions \"67 einzelne Früchte über den Strauch verteilt,\" which translates to 67 individual fruits spread over the bush. So, those are in addition to the clusters. So, adding them together gives the total. I think that's all there is to it. No, I don't see any other numbers or parts mentioned.

The problem is about figuring out how many oranges are good in a basket. There are 25 oranges total. The question mentions that one is bad, 20% are unripe, and two are sour. The rest are good. I need to find out how many are good.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information. Total oranges: 25. Then, there are different categories: bad, unripe, sour, and good. The bad one is straightforward—1 orange. Then 20% are unripe. Hmm, 20% of 25. Let me calculate that. 20% is 0.2 in decimal, so 0.2 times 25. That would be 5 oranges. So 5 unripe.\n\nThen there are 2 sour oranges. So, adding those up: 1 bad + 5 unripe + 2 sour. That's 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges. So, if there are 25 total, subtract those 8 to find the good ones. 25 - 8 = 17. So, 17 good oranges?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"der Rest gut ist,\" which means the rest are good. So, the total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges are the ones that are not good. So, adding them up: 1 bad, 5 unripe, 2 sour. That's 8. So 25 - 8 = 17. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, is there any overlap? Like, could the bad orange also be unripe or sour? The problem doesn't specify that. It just says 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. So, I think we can assume they are separate categories. So, the bad one is separate from the unripe and sour. So, adding them all together is okay.\n\nSo, 1 + 5 + 2 = 8. 25 - 8 = 17. Therefore, the answer should be 17 good oranges. Let me just confirm the math again. 20% of 25 is 5, yes. 1 + 5 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 25 minus 8 is 17. Yep, that seems correct.

So adding those two together, that's 500 + 800 = $1300. Then she pays 10% of this amount for insurance. So 10% of $1300 is 0.10 * 1300 = $130.

Now, the question is, if she leaves after 30 years, what is her annual pension then?\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the structure of her pension. The problem says that after 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the annual pension per year. Wait, does that mean that after 20 years, her pension increases by 5% annually? Or is it a one-time 5% addition? The wording is a bit unclear.

Or is it that after 20 years, she receives 5% of the original pension amount each year? That would be $2,500 per year. But that seems too low. Alternatively, maybe the pension is calculated as 5% of the value of the annual pension, which would be 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500. But then, if she leaves after 30 years, would that be added to her original pension?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Nach 20 Jahren werden ihr 5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, after 20 years, she is granted 5% of the value of the annual pension per year. So, if the annual pension is $50,000, then 5% of that is $2,500. So, does that mean that after 20 years, she gets an additional $2,500 per year? So her total pension would be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 per year?\n\nBut then, if she leaves after 30 years, does that mean she gets the same $52,500? Or is there a different calculation? Wait, maybe the 5% is not an addition but a multiplier. Like, after 20 years, her pension is 5% of the original value. But that would be $2,500, which seems low. Alternatively, maybe the pension is calculated based on the number of years worked, and after 20 years, she gets 5% more each year. But the problem states \"5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, 5% of the annual pension value per year. That might mean that each year after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension. But that would be $2,500 per year, added to her original $50,000. So total $52,500.\n\nBut then, if she leaves after 30 years, does that mean she gets the same $52,500? Or is there a different calculation? Wait, maybe the pension is calculated based on the number of years worked. For example, if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. But after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension. So, maybe the pension is calculated as follows: for the first 20 years, she gets $50,000, and after that, she gets 5% more each year. But that would be $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500. So, if she leaves after 30 years, she would get $52,500 per year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5% is a one-time addition after 20 years. But the wording says \"pro Jahr\" which is \"per year,\" so it's an annual amount. So, after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension each year. So, that would be $2,500 per year added to her original $50,000, making it $52,500. Therefore, if she leaves after 30 years, her annual pension would be $52,500.\n\nWait, but maybe the pension is calculated based on the number of years worked. For example, if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. But after 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the annual pension. So, maybe the pension is calculated as $50,000 plus 5% of $50,000 for each year after 20 years. But that would be $50,000 + 5% * $50,000 * (number of years after 20). But she leaves after 30 years, so that's 10 years after 20. So, $50,000 + 5% * $50,000 * 10 = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000. But that seems like a lot. However, the problem says \"5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, 5% of the annual pension per year. If the annual pension is $50,000, then 5% of that is $2,500 per year. So, if she works for 30 years, she gets $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500. But that would be the same as if she left after 20 years. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the 5% is applied annually after 20 years. So, starting from year 21, her pension increases by 5% each year. So, year 21: $50,000 * 1.05, year 22: $50,000 * 1.05^2, etc. Then, after 30 years, it would be $50,000 * 1.05^(10) = $50,000 * 1.62889 = $81,444.50. But the problem says \"5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, maybe it's a one-time 5% addition after 20 years, not a compounding increase. That is, after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension, which is $2,500, so total $52,500. Then, if she leaves after 30 years, she still gets $52,500. But that seems too simple. However, the problem might be that after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension, which is $2,500, so her total pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500. Therefore, regardless of when she leaves after 20 years, she gets $52,500. But that would mean that even if she leaves after 30 years, it's still $52,500. But maybe the 5% is applied annually after 20 years. So, each year after 20, she gets 5% more. So, year 21: 5% of $50,000 = $2,500, year 22: another 5% of $50,000, etc. But that would be $2,500 per year added each year after 20. So, after 30 years, she has 10 years of 5% additions, so $2,500 * 10 = $25,000 added to the original $50,000, making it $75,000. But that seems like a lot. However, the problem states \"5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, \"5% of the value of the annual pension per year.\" If the annual pension is $50,000, then 5% of that is $2,500 per year. So, if she works for 30 years, she gets $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500. But that would be the same as if she left after 20 years. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the 5% is a one-time addition after 20 years, so she gets $50,000 + 5% of $50,000 = $52,500, and that's her pension for the rest of her life, regardless of when she leaves. Therefore, if she leaves after 30 years, her pension is $52,500. But the problem might be more complex. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Wenn Marcy 40 Jahre lang für das gleiche Unternehmen tätig ist, bekommt sie eine jährliche Rente von 50.000 US-Dollar/Jahr. Nach 20 Jahren werden ihr 5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden. Wenn sie nach 30 Jahren geht, wie hoch ist dann ihre jährliche Rente?\"\n\nSo, if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000/year. After 20 years, she is granted 5% of the value of the annual pension per year. So, when she leaves after 30 years, what is her annual pension?\n\nSo, the key is that after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension. So, if the annual pension is $50,000, then 5% of that is $2,500. So, does that mean her pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500? Or is the 5% a multiplier? Like, after 20 years, her pension is 5% of the original value? That would be $2,500, which seems low. But the wording says \"5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, \"5% of the value of the annual pension per year.\" So, per year, she gets 5% of the annual pension. That would be $2,500 per year. So, added to her original pension? Or is it that her pension becomes 5% of the original value? That's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pension is calculated based on the number of years worked. For example, if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. But after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension. So, maybe the pension is calculated as $50,000 plus 5% of $50,000 for each year after 20. But that would be $50,000 + 5% * $50,000 * (number of years after 20). If she leaves after 30 years, that's 10 years after 20, so $50,000 + 5% * $50,000 * 10 = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000. But that seems like a lot. However, the problem might be that after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension, which is $2,500, so her total pension is $52,500. Therefore, regardless of when she leaves after 20 years, it's $52,500. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the 5% is applied annually after 20 years, so each year after 20, her pension increases by 5%. So, year 21: $50,000 * 1.05, year 22: $50,000 * 1.05^2, etc. Then, after 30 years, it would be $50,000 * 1.05^(10) = $50,000 * 1.62889 = $81,444.50. But the problem doesn't mention compounding, so that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pension is calculated as follows: For the first 20 years, she gets $50,000. After 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension, which is $2,500, so her total pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500. Therefore, if she leaves after 30 years, she still gets $52,500. That seems plausible. But the problem says \"Nach 20 Jahren werden ihr 5 % des Wertes der jährlichen Rente pro Jahr zugestanden.\" So, \"after 20 years, she is granted 5% of the value of the annual pension per year.\" So, per year, she gets 5% of the annual pension. If the annual pension is $50,000, then 5% of that is $2,500 per year. So, that would be an additional $2,500 per year. Therefore, her total pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500. Therefore, regardless of when she leaves after 20 years, she gets $52,500. So, if she leaves after 30 years, it's still $52,500. That seems to be the answer.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me think again. If she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. But after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension. So, maybe the pension is calculated based on the number of years worked. For example, if she works for 20 years, she gets some amount, and after that, it increases by 5% per year. But the problem states that if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. So, maybe the $50,000 is the pension after 40 years. But the question is about if she leaves after 30 years, what is her pension. So, perhaps the pension is calculated as a function of years worked. For example, if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. If she works for 30 years, maybe it's less. But the problem says that after 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension. So, maybe the pension is $50,000 for 40 years, but after 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of that. So, $50,000 + 5% of $50,000 = $52,500. Therefore, if she leaves after 30 years, she gets $52,500. That seems to be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pension is calculated as follows: For each year worked, she gets a certain amount. After 20 years, she gets 5% of the annual pension. So, if she works for 30 years, she gets the base pension plus 5% for the years after 20. But the problem states that if she works for 40 years, she gets $50,000. So, maybe the base pension is $50,000 for 40 years, and after 20 years, she gets 5% of that. So, $50,000 + 5% of $50,000 = $52,500. Therefore, regardless of when she leaves after 20 years, she gets $52,500. That seems to be the answer.\n\nI think the answer is $52,500. So, the final answer is $52,500, which is 50,000 + 5% of 50,000 = 52,500.\n</think>\n\nMarcy erhält eine jährliche Rente von 50.000 USD, wenn sie 40 Jahre für das Unternehmen tätig ist.

Aleena has a streaming service that costs $140 per month. The question is about calculating the total she'll pay by the end of the year, considering that the first half of the year is charged at the original rate, and the second half is 10% less. Hmm, okay, so first I need to break down the year into two halves. A year has 12 months, so half a year would be 6 months each. \n\nSo for the first 6 months, she pays the full $140 each month. Then for the next 6 months, the price is reduced by 10%. I need to calculate the total for each half and then add them together. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst half: 6 months at $140 per month. That would be 6 multiplied by 140. Let me do that calculation. 6 times 140... Well, 10 times 140 is 1400, so 6 times 140 is 840. So that's $840 for the first half.\n\nNow the second half. The price is 10% less than the original. So 10% of $140 is... 10% of 140 is 14. So subtracting that from 140 gives 140 - 14 = $126 per month for the second half. Then, again, 6 months at $126. Let me calculate that. 6 times 126. Hmm, 6 times 100 is 600, 6 times 20 is 120, and 6 times 6 is 36. Adding those together: 600 + 120 = 720, plus 36 is 756. So the second half is $756.\n\nNow, adding both halves together: $840 (first half) + $756 (second half). Let's add those. 800 + 700 is 1500, 40 + 56 is 96. So total is 1500 + 96 = $1596. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 840 + 756. Breaking it down: 800 + 700 = 1500, 40 + 50 = 90, 6 + 6 = 12. Wait, that would be 1500 + 90 + 12 = 1602? Wait, no, maybe I messed up the breakdown. Let me do it more carefully. 840 + 756. Let's add 800 + 700 = 1500, then 40 + 50 = 90, and 0 + 6 = 6. So 1500 + 90 = 1590, plus 6 is 1596. Yes, that's correct. So total is $1596.\n\nAlternatively, I can check using another method. 840 + 756. Let's add 840 + 700 = 1540, then add 56: 1540 + 56 = 1596. Yep, same result. So that seems right.\n\nSo the total amount Aleena will pay by the end of the year is $1596. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the percentage calculation. The second half is 10% less, so 10% of 140 is indeed 14, so 140 - 14 = 126. Then 6 months at 126 is 756. That seems correct. And the first half is straightforward 6*140=840.

Sophia wants to know how far she can drive on a full tank of gas. So, the problem says that since her last fill-up, she drove 100 miles and had to add 4 gallons to refill the tank. The car's tank holds 12 gallons. Hmm, I need to figure out the miles per gallon first, right?\n\nWait, so if she drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons, that means her car's fuel efficiency is 100 miles divided by 4 gallons. Let me calculate that. 100 divided by 4 is 25. So, she gets 25 miles per gallon. But wait, the tank holds 12 gallons. So, if she fills the tank completely, she can drive 25 miles per gallon times 12 gallons. That would be 25 times 12. Let me do that multiplication. 25 times 10 is 250, and 25 times 2 is 50, so 250 plus 50 is 300. So, 300 miles?\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because the 100 miles was driven on 4 gallons, which is the amount she added to refill the tank. But does that mean that the 4 gallons was the amount she used since the last fill-up? So, if the tank holds 12 gallons, and she had to add 4 gallons to refill it, that means she used 4 gallons to drive 100 miles. Therefore, the fuel efficiency is indeed 100/4 = 25 mpg. Then, with a full tank of 12 gallons, she can drive 25 * 12 = 300 miles. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes when you refill, you might not have driven exactly the amount that would empty the tank. For example, if the tank was full before, and she drove until it was empty, then she would have used the entire 12 gallons. But in this case, she only used 4 gallons to refill, which suggests that she had 8 gallons left in the tank when she filled up. So, the 100 miles were driven on 4 gallons, which is the amount she added. Therefore, the calculation is correct. So, 25 mpg times 12 gallons is 300 miles. Yeah, that makes sense.

The problem is about Jim's activities: watching TV and reading. I need to figure out how many hours he spends on both in 4 weeks. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Jim watches TV for 2 hours each time. Then he decides to go to bed and read for half as long as he watched TV. So, half of 2 hours is 1 hour. So each time he does this routine, he spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading. That totals 3 hours per session.\n\nNow, he does this 3 times a week. So per week, the total time would be 3 sessions multiplied by 3 hours each. Let me calculate that: 3 times 3 is 9 hours per week.\n\nBut the question asks for 4 weeks. So I need to multiply the weekly total by 4. 9 hours per week times 4 weeks equals 36 hours. Wait, but hold on, let me check again to make sure I didn't mix up anything.\n\nWait, the initial calculation: each session is 2 hours TV + 1 hour reading = 3 hours. Then 3 sessions per week: 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week. Then over 4 weeks: 9 * 4 = 36 hours. That seems right. But let me verify each part again.\n\nTV time per session: 2 hours. Reading time per session: half of 2 hours is 1 hour. So per session, total is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Correct. Then 3 sessions a week: 3 * 3 = 9 hours. Then 4 weeks: 9 * 4 = 36. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate TV and reading separately and then add them up. Let's try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nTV time per session: 2 hours. 3 sessions per week: 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV per week. Reading time per session: 1 hour. 3 sessions per week: 1 * 3 = 3 hours of reading per week. Total per week: 6 + 3 = 9 hours. Then over 4 weeks: 9 * 4 = 36. Same result. Okay, that confirms it.\n\nSo the answer should be 36 hours. I think that's correct. Let me just check if there's any chance I misread the problem. The problem says he does this 3 times per week. Each time, he watches TV for 2 hours and then reads half as long. So yes, each time it's 2 hours TV and 1 hour reading. So 3 times a week, 3*2=6 TV, 3*1=3 reading.

Also, each school has sent a coach for each team. The question is asking how many people in total the schools have sent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the problem step by step. Let me start by considering one school first and then multiply by four since there are four schools.\n\nSo, for one school: they have two teams, a girls' and a boys' team. Each team has 5 players. That's 5 players for the girls and 5 for the boys, so 5 + 5 = 10 players per school. Then, each team also has a coach. So, that's one coach for the girls' team and one for the boys' team. That adds 2 coaches per school.\n\nSo, per school, the total number of people is players plus coaches. That would be 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people per school.\n\nNow, since there are four schools, I need to multiply the number of people per school by 4. So, 12 people per school times 4 schools. Let me calculate that: 12 * 4 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Each school has two teams, each with 5 players. So 2 teams * 5 players = 10 players. Then, two coaches, one for each team. So 2 coaches. So 10 + 2 = 12 per school. Four schools: 12 * 4 = 48. That seems right.\n\nBut hold on, is there a possibility that the coaches are counted differently? Like, maybe each coach is only for one team, so two coaches per school. Yes, that's what the question says: \"jeder Schule hat einen Trainer für jedes Team mitgeschickt.\" So \"each school has sent a coach for each team.\" So each team has one coach, so two coaches per school. That's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: are the players and coaches all distinct individuals? The question says \"jedes Team hat 5 Spieler\" and \"jeder Schule hat einen Trainer für jedes Team mitgeschickt.\" So the players are separate from the coaches. So no overlap there. So each school sends 10 players and 2 coaches, totaling 12 per school. Multiply by four schools gives 48.\n\nHmm, I think that's it. Let me just visualize it again.

The problem is about a treasure hunter who found a chest with different types of gemstones. The question is asking how many gemstones are in the chest in total.

That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the rubies are 35 fewer than diamonds. So, if diamonds are 175, then rubies would be 175 minus 35. Let me calculate that: 175 - 35. Hmm, 175 minus 30 is 145, and then minus 5 more is 140. So, rubies are 140.\n\nThen, the emeralds are twice as many as rubies. Since rubies are 140, emeralds would be 2 times 140. Let me do that multiplication: 140 * 2. That's 280.\n\nNow, to find the total number of gemstones, I need to add up diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. So, 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds). Let's add them step by step.\n\nFirst, 175 + 140. Let's see, 175 + 100 is 275, then +40 is 315. Then, adding the 280 emeralds: 315 + 280. Breaking that down, 300 + 200 is 500, 15 + 80 is 95. So, 500 + 95 is 595. Wait, that seems right? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, 315 + 280. 315 + 200 = 515, then +80 = 595. Yes, same result. So total gemstones would be 595.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. Diamonds are 175, rubies are 175 - 35 = 140. Emeralds are 2 * 140 = 280. Then total is 175 + 140 + 280. Let me add them again:\n\n175 + 140 = 315. Then 315 + 280. Let's do 315 + 280. 300 + 200 = 500, 15 + 80 = 95. 500 + 95 = 595. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. Let's see:\n\nTotal = Diamonds + Rubies + Emeralds\n\nDiamonds = 175\n\nRubies = Diamonds - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140\n\nEmeralds = 2 * Rubies = 2 * 140 = 280\n\nTotal = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So the answer should be 595 gemstones in total.\n\nI think that's all. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the arithmetic checks out. So I'm confident the total number is 595.\n</think>\n\nDer Schatzsucher fand 175 Diamanten.

The problem says that at Dr. Wertz's school, there are twice as many boys as girls. There are 60 girls, and there are 5 students per teacher. The question is asking how many teachers there are.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the number of boys. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, then the number of boys should be 2 times 60. Let me calculate that: 2 * 60 = 120 boys. So, there are 120 boys.\n\nNow, to find the total number of students, I need to add the number of boys and girls together. That would be 60 girls + 120 boys. Let me add those: 60 + 120 = 180 students in total.\n\nThe problem states that there are 5 students per teacher. So, to find the number of teachers, I need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher. That would be 180 students divided by 5 students per teacher. Let me do that division: 180 / 5 = 36.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 5 times 36 is 180, right? 5*30=150 and 5*6=30, so 150+30=180. Yes, that's correct. So, there are 36 teachers.\n\nHmm, does that make sense? If each teacher has 5 students, then 36 teachers would have 36*5=180 students, which matches the total number of students we calculated earlier. So, that seems to check out.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key steps were figuring out the number of boys, adding them to the girls to get the total students, and then dividing by the student-teacher ratio. All the numbers seem to add up correctly.

So the problem is about Bailey who starts with a certain amount of money. Then she gets a weekly payment of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of those 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. The question is asking how much money she had at the beginning.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, she has some initial amount, let's call that \"x\" dollars. Then, every week for 8 weeks, she gets $5. So over 8 weeks, how much does she get in total from those weekly payments? Well, 8 weeks times $5 per week would be 8 * 5 = $40. So she gets an additional $40 from the weekly payments.\n\nNow, the total amount she has at the end is $100. That total should be her initial amount plus the money she earned from the weekly payments. So the equation would be:\n\nInitial amount (x) + weekly earnings ($40) = Total amount ($100)\n\nSo, x + 40 = 100. To find x, we subtract 40 from both sides:\n\nx = 100 - 40\nx = 60\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says she starts with a certain amount, then receives $5 each week for 8 weeks. So yes, 8 weeks * $5 = $40. Then total is initial plus that $40 equals $100. So initial is $60. That seems right.\n\nHmm, is there any chance that the $5 is added at the end of each week, so maybe there's some compounding or something? But the problem doesn't mention any interest or compounding. It just says she receives $5 each week. So it's a simple addition. So I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If she had $100 at the end, and she earned $40 over the 8 weeks, then she must have started with $100 - $40 = $60. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't see any other factors here. The problem is pretty straightforward.

Judy teaches dance classes. The question is asking how much money she makes in a week. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, she teaches 5 dance classes daily on weekends. Wait, weekends are Saturday and Sunday, right? So does that mean she teaches 5 classes each day on Saturday and Sunday? Or is it 5 classes in total on weekends? The wording says \"täglich, an den Wochenenden und 8 Kurse am Samstag.\" Hmm, the original German might be a bit tricky here. Let me parse that again.\n\n\"Judy unterrichtet 5 Tanzkurse, täglich, an den Wochenenden und 8 Kurse am Samstag.\" So \"täglich\" means daily, but \"an den Wochenenden\" is on weekends. Wait, that might be conflicting. If she teaches 5 classes daily on weekends, that would be 5 classes on Saturday and 5 on Sunday. But then it also says \"und 8 Kurse am Samstag.\" So maybe there's a translation issue here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 5 classes daily on weekends (so Saturday and Sunday each have 5 classes) plus 8 classes on Saturday. That would mean on Saturday she has 5 + 8 = 13 classes, and on Sunday 5 classes. But that seems a bit odd. Or perhaps the original German is structured differently. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Judy unterrichtet 5 Tanzkurse, täglich, an den Wochenenden und 8 Kurse am Samstag.\" So \"täglich\" (daily) and \"an den Wochenenden\" (on weekends). Maybe it's 5 classes each day on weekends (Saturday and Sunday), and additionally 8 classes on Saturday. That would mean Saturday has 5 + 8 = 13 classes, and Sunday has 5 classes. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe \"täglich\" is modifying \"an den Wochenenden,\" meaning she teaches 5 classes on weekends (total) and 8 on Saturday. But that would be conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the original German is \"5 Tanzkurse, täglich, an den Wochenenden und 8 Kurse am Samstag.\" So \"täglich\" might be misplaced. Maybe it's \"5 Tanzkurse täglich an den Wochenenden und 8 Kurse am Samstag.\" That would mean she teaches 5 classes each day on weekends (so Saturday and Sunday each have 5 classes) and also 8 classes on Saturday. That would make Saturday have 5 + 8 = 13 classes, and Sunday 5 classes. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe \"täglich\" is not part of the weekend teaching. Maybe she teaches 5 classes daily (on weekdays?) and on weekends she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. But the original says \"an den Wochenenden\" which is weekends, so Saturday and Sunday. Hmm.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to think of possible interpretations. If the user is translating from German, maybe the original structure is that she teaches 5 classes daily on weekends (so Saturday and Sunday each have 5 classes) and also 8 classes on Saturday. That would mean Saturday has 5 + 8 = 13 classes, Sunday has 5. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe \"täglich\" is not part of the weekend teaching. Maybe she teaches 5 classes on weekends (total) and 8 on Saturday. But that would be conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original German is \"5 Tanzkurse täglich, an den Wochenenden und 8 Kurse am Samstag.\" So she teaches 5 classes daily on weekends (so Saturday and Sunday each have 5 classes) and also 8 classes on Saturday. That would mean Saturday has 5 + 8 = 13 classes, Sunday has 5. But that seems like a lot. However, maybe the user made a mistake in the translation. Alternatively, maybe \"täglich\" is not part of the weekend teaching. Maybe she teaches 5 classes on weekends (total) and 8 on Saturday. But that would be 5 on weekends (maybe Saturday and Sunday) and 8 on Saturday. That would be 5 on weekends (maybe 2.5 each day?), which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original German is \"5 Tanzkurse täglich an den Wochenenden und 8 Kurse am Samstag.\" So \"täglich\" here might mean that on each weekend day (Saturday and Sunday), she teaches 5 classes. So that's 5 classes on Saturday and 5 on Sunday. Then, additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. So total Saturday classes: 5 + 8 = 13, Sunday: 5. That would be 13 + 5 = 18 classes in total for the weekend. But that seems like a lot. However, maybe that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAssuming that, then total classes per week would be 13 (Saturday) + 5 (Sunday) = 18 classes. Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15 per student. So total money per week would be 18 classes * 15 students * $15.\n\nBut let me check again. If she teaches 5 classes daily on weekends (so Saturday and Sunday each have 5 classes) and 8 classes on Saturday, that would be 5 + 8 = 13 on Saturday and 5 on Sunday. So total 18 classes. Then 18 * 15 students * $15.\n\nBut maybe the original question is different. Let me check the original question again: \"Judy unterrichtet 5 Tanzkurse, täglich, an den Wochenenden und 8 Kurse am Samstag.\" So maybe the structure is that she teaches 5 classes daily on weekends (so Saturday and Sunday each have 5 classes) and also 8 classes on Saturday. That would be 5 + 8 = 13 on Saturday and 5 on Sunday. So total 18 classes. Then, each class has 15 students, so 18 * 15 = 270 students. Each student pays $15, so 270 * 15 = $4050.\n\nBut maybe the user made a mistake in the translation. Alternatively, maybe \"täglich\" is not part of the weekend teaching. Maybe she teaches 5 classes on weekends (total) and 8 on Saturday. But that would be conflicting. Alternatively, maybe \"täglich\" is part of the 8 Kurse am Samstag. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original German is \"5 Tanzkurse täglich an den Wochenenden und 8 Kurse am Samstag.\" So \"täglich\" here might mean that on each weekend day (Saturday and Sunday), she teaches 5 classes. So that's 5 classes on Saturday and 5 on Sunday. Then, additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. So Saturday has 5 + 8 = 13 classes, Sunday has 5. Total 18 classes. Then, 18 * 15 students * $15 = 18*15*15.\n\nCalculating that: 18*15 = 270, 270*15 = 4050. So $4050 per week.\n\nBut maybe the user intended that she teaches 5 classes on weekends (total) and 8 on Saturday. But that would be 5 on weekends (maybe Saturday and Sunday) and 8 on Saturday. That would be 5 + 8 = 13 on Saturday and 0 on Sunday? That doesn't make sense. So probably the first interpretation is correct: 5 classes daily on weekends (so Saturday and Sunday each have 5) plus 8 on Saturday, totaling 13 on Saturday and 5 on Sunday. So 18 classes total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"täglich\" is not part of the weekend teaching. Maybe she teaches 5 classes on weekends (total) and 8 on Saturday. But that would be 5 on weekends (maybe Saturday and Sunday) and 8 on Saturday. That would be 5 on weekends (maybe 2.5 each day?), which is not possible. So the first interpretation is more plausible.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be 18 classes * 15 students * $15 = $4050.\n</think>\n\nJudy unterrichtet an den Wochenenden täglich 5 Tanzkurse, was bedeutet, dass sie an Samstag und Sonntag jeweils 5 Kurse hat.

He sold 43 brownies and 23 cheese cake pieces. I need to figure out how much money he collected in total.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total amount from the brownies. If each brownie is $3, then multiplying the number of brownies by the price per brownie should give the total for that. So 43 brownies times $3. Let me do that math. 40 times 3 is 120, and 3 times 3 is 9, so 120 + 9 = 129. So that's $129 from brownies.\n\nNext, the cheese cake pieces. Each is $4, and he sold 23 of them. So 23 times 4.

Hmm, okay, first, I should calculate the total cost of the phones without interest. Then, add the interest, and then divide by three months. Wait, but the interest is per piece, so maybe I need to calculate the interest per phone and then total it?\n\nSo, each phone is $150. Five phones would be 5 * 150 = $750. Then, the interest is 2% per piece. So, for each phone, the interest is 2% of $150. Let me calculate that. 2% of 150 is 0.02 * 150 = $3 per phone. So, for five phones, the total interest would be 5 * $3 = $15. Therefore, the total amount Sheila has to pay is $750 + $15 = $765. Then, she pays this over three months, so each month she pays 765 / 3 = $255. Is that right?\n\nWait, but maybe the interest is calculated differently. Like, is the 2% per month or per the entire period? The question says \"Pro Stück werden 2 % Zinsen verlangt.\" So, per piece, 2% interest. But does that mean 2% per month or 2% total over the three months? The wording is a bit unclear. If it's 2% per month, then the calculation would be different. But the problem says \"Ratenzahlungsvertrag über 3 Monate\" which is a payment plan over 3 months. So, maybe the 2% is the total interest for the entire period, not per month. That would make sense. So, 2% of the total amount. Wait, but the question says \"Pro Stück werden 2 % Zinsen verlangt.\" So, per piece, 2% interest. So, per phone, 2% interest. So, if each phone is $150, then 2% of that is $3, as I calculated before. So total interest is $15, total amount $765, divided by 3 months is $255 per month. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe the interest is compounded monthly? Wait, the problem doesn't mention compounding. It just says 2% per piece. So, maybe it's simple interest. So, total interest is 2% of the principal. So, total principal is 5*150=750. 2% of 750 is 15. So total amount is 765. Divided by 3 months is 255. So, that's the answer. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, if the 2% is per month, then the interest would be calculated each month. But that would be more complicated. For example, if it's 2% per month on the principal. But the question says \"Pro Stück werden 2 % Zinsen verlangt.\" So, per piece, 2% interest. It doesn't specify per month, so maybe it's a flat rate for the entire period. So, 2% of the total amount. So, 2% of 750 is 15. So, total payment is 765. Divided by 3 months is 255. That seems to be the answer. I think that's correct. So, Sheila pays $255 each month for three months.\n</think>\n\nShiela kauft 5 Handys zu je 150 USD, was einen Gesamtbetrag von $5 \\times 150 = 750$ USD ergibt.

Artie is selling flowers and has to round up all the prices to the next whole dollar because he doesn't have change. So, I need to figure out how much he earns by rounding each flower's price up and then multiplying by the number of pots sold for each type. \n\nFirst, let me note down the original prices:\n\n- Marigolds (Ringelblumen): $2.74 per pot\n- Petunias: $1.87 per pot\n- Begonias: $2.12 per pot\n\nHe rounds each price up to the next dollar. So, for each flower type, I need to determine what the next whole dollar amount is.\n\nStarting with Marigolds: $2.74. The next whole dollar after 2.74 is $3.00 because 2.74 is more than $2.00 but less than $3.00, so rounding up would be $3.\n\nPetunias: $1.87. Similarly, the next whole dollar is $2.00. Even though 1.87 is close to $2, since he's rounding up, it's $2.\n\nBegonias: $2.12. The next whole dollar is $3.00? Wait, no. Wait, $2.12 is between $2 and $3. So rounding up would be $3? Wait, but if the price is $2.12, the next higher dollar is $3? Or is it $2.00? Wait, no. Wait, rounding up to the next dollar. So if the price is $2.12, the next dollar is $3.00? Because $2.12 is more than $2.00, so the next whole dollar is $3.00. But wait, sometimes people might think of rounding to the nearest dollar, but the question says \"nächsthöheren Dollarbetrag\", which translates to \"next higher dollar amount\", so it's always rounding up to the next whole dollar, regardless of the cents. So even if it's $2.01, it would be rounded up to $3.00? Wait, no. Wait, if you have $2.01, the next higher dollar is $3.00? Or is it $2.00? Wait, no. If you have $2.01, the next higher dollar would be $3.00? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the question is that he rounds up to the nearest whole dollar, meaning if it's $2.01, it becomes $3.00? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe the question is that he rounds up to the next whole dollar, meaning if the price is not a whole number, he rounds it up to the next whole number. So for example, $2.74 would be $3.00, $1.87 would be $2.00, and $2.12 would be $3.00? Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal prices:\n\n- Marigolds: $2.74. Since it's $2.74, the next whole dollar is $3.00. Correct.\n\n- Petunias: $1.87. The next whole dollar is $2.00. Correct.\n\n- Begonias: $2.12. The next whole dollar is $3.00? Wait, $2.12 is between $2 and $3. So if you round up to the next whole dollar, it's $3.00. But that seems like a big jump. But the question says \"nächsthöheren Dollarbetrag\", which is \"next higher dollar amount\". So if the price is not a whole number, you round up to the next whole number. So even if it's $2.01, it would be $3.00? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the question is that he rounds up to the nearest dollar, but if it's already a whole number, he leaves it as is. But the original prices are not whole numbers. So for example, $2.74 is not a whole number, so he rounds up to $3.00. $1.87 is not a whole number, so he rounds up to $2.00. $2.12 is not a whole number, so he rounds up to $3.00. Wait, but $2.12 is only 12 cents over $2.00, so rounding up to $3.00 would be a $0.88 increase. That seems like a lot. But maybe that's what the question says. Let me check the original question again.\n\n\"Er verkauft normalerweise Ringelblumen für 2,74 US-Dollar pro Topf, Petunien für 1,87 US-Dollar pro Topf und Begonien für 2,12 US-Dollar pro Topf. Artie hat heute kein Wechselgeld, also entschließt er sich, alle Preise auf den nächsthöheren Dollarbetrag aufzurunden.\"\n\nSo \"auf den nächsthöheren Dollarbetrag aufzurunden\" translates to \"round up to the next higher dollar amount\". So for each price, regardless of how close it is to the next dollar, he rounds up. So $2.74 becomes $3.00, $1.87 becomes $2.00, $2.12 becomes $3.00. That seems correct according to the wording.\n\nSo then, the new prices are:\n\n- Marigolds: $3.00 per pot\n\n- Petunias: $2.00 per pot\n\n- Begonias: $3.00 per pot\n\nWait, but Begonias are $2.12, which is $2.12. The next higher dollar is $3.00? Because $2.12 is more than $2.00, so the next higher dollar is $3.00? Wait, but if you have $2.00, the next higher dollar is $3.00. But if the price is $2.00, it's already a whole number. But in this case, the original price is $2.12, which is not a whole number, so he rounds up to the next whole dollar, which is $3.00. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo then, the new prices are:\n\nMarigolds: $3.00\n\nPetunias: $2.00\n\nBegonias: $3.00\n\nNow, he sells 12 Marigolds, 9 Petunias, and 17 Begonias.\n\nCalculating the total earnings:\n\nFor Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00\n\nFor Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 = $18.00\n\nFor Begonias: 17 pots * $3.00 = $51.00\n\nAdding them all together: $36 + $18 + $51 = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n$36 + $18 = $54\n\n$54 + $51 = $105\n\nSo total earnings would be $105.00.\n\nWait, but let me check again if the Begonias are correctly rounded up. If the original price is $2.12, the next higher dollar is $3.00? Because $2.12 is between $2 and $3. So if you round up to the next whole dollar, it's $3.00. Yes, that's correct. So even though it's only 12 cents over $2, he still rounds up to $3. So that's how it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe \"nächsthöheren Dollarbetrag\" is meant to be the nearest dollar, but if it's exactly halfway, round up. But the question says \"aufzurunden\", which is \"to round up\", so it's definitely rounding up to the next whole dollar, not rounding to the nearest. So even if it's $2.01, it becomes $3.00. So that's the case here.\n\nTherefore, the total earnings are $105.00.\n\nBut let me verify once more:\n\nMarigolds: 12 * 3 = 36\n\nPetunias: 9 * 2 = 18\n\nBegonias: 17 * 3 = 51\n\nTotal: 36 + 18 = 54; 54 + 51 = 105.

Wait, the top level is 16, so the one below it must be double that, right? Because each level is half the one below. So if the top is 16, the second level from the top would be 32. Then the third level would be 64, and the bottom one would be 128? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"jede Ebene einer Sandburg nur halb so viele Quadratmeter hat wie die darunterliegende Ebene.\" So each level is half the area of the one below it. So the level above is half the one below. So if the top level is 16, then the level below it (second level) is 16 * 2 = 32.

Cecilia just got a new puppy, and she needs to feed it according to the vet's advice. The problem is asking how many bags of dog food she'll use in the first year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the puppy needs 1 cup of food per day for the first 180 days. After that, it needs 2 cups per day for the rest of its life. But the question is about the first year, which is 365 days. So I need to figure out how much food is needed in those 365 days, considering the change after 180 days.\n\nLet me start by calculating the amount of food for the first 180 days. That's 1 cup per day, so 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups.\n\nThen, the remaining days in the first year would be 365 - 180 = 185 days. For these 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups per day. So that's 185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups.\n\nAdding those two amounts together: 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups total in the first year.\n\nNow, each bag contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags she needs, I divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag. So 550 cups / 110 cups per bag = 5 bags.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's any rounding needed. Since 550 divided by 110 is exactly 5, there's no need for extra bags. So the answer should be 5 bags.\n\nLet me double-check the days. First 180 days, then 185 days. 180 + 185 is 365, which is correct for a year. The calculations for the cups seem right. 180*1=180, 185*2=370, total 550. Divided by 110 gives exactly 5.

The problem is about Raymond, Sarah, and David washing clothes. I need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David wash when Sarah washes 400 pounds. \n\nFirst, the problem says Raymond washes half as much as Sarah. So if Sarah does 400 pounds, Raymond would do half of that. Let me write that down: Raymond = Sarah / 2. Since Sarah is 400, Raymond would be 400 divided by 2, which is 200 pounds. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, it mentions Sarah washes 4 times as much as David. So Sarah's amount is 4 times David's. To find David's amount, I need to divide Sarah's by 4. So David = Sarah / 4. Plugging in Sarah's 400 pounds, David would do 400 divided by 4, which is 100 pounds. \n\nNow, the question asks for the difference between Raymond and David's laundry. So I subtract David's amount from Raymond's. That would be 200 (Raymond) minus 100 (David), which equals 100 pounds. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If Sarah is 400, Raymond is half of that, so 200. David is a quarter of Sarah's, so 100. The difference between Raymond and David is 200 - 100 = 100. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here.

Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers, and he can choose between two different packaging options. The first option is 3-packs for $2.50 each, and the second is 2-packs for $1 each. The question is asking how much money he can save by buying the 18 flowers at the better price. Hmm, so I need to figure out which package is cheaper per flower and then calculate the total cost for 18 flowers using that package, and then compare it to the other option to find the savings.\n\nFirst, maybe I should find out the price per flower for each package. That way, I can see which one is cheaper. Let's start with the 3-packs. Each 3-pack costs $2.50, so the price per flower would be $2.50 divided by 3. Let me calculate that: 2.50 / 3. Hmm, 2.50 divided by 3 is approximately 0.8333 dollars per flower. So about 83.33 cents per flower.\n\nNow for the 2-packs. Each 2-pack is $1, so the price per flower is $1 divided by 2, which is $0.50 per flower. That's 50 cents per flower. So clearly, the 2-packs are cheaper per flower. Therefore, Vincent should buy as many 2-packs as possible to save money.\n\nBut wait, he needs exactly 18 flowers. Let me check if 18 can be divided evenly by 2. Yes, 18 divided by 2 is 9. So he can buy 9 packs of 2, which would give him exactly 18 flowers. The total cost would be 9 packs times $1 each, which is $9.00.\n\nBut let me also check the other option just to be sure. If he buys 3-packs, how many would he need? 18 divided by 3 is 6. So 6 packs of 3. Each pack is $2.50, so 6 times 2.50 is... 6*2 is 12, and 6*0.50 is 3, so total $15.00. So buying 3-packs would cost $15, while buying 2-packs costs $9. The difference is $15 - $9 = $6. So he saves $6 by buying the 2-packs.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a combination of both packages that could be cheaper? Let me think. For example, if he buys some 3-packs and some 2-packs to get exactly 18 flowers. But since 18 is divisible by both 2 and 3, maybe not necessary. But just to check, suppose he buys 5 packs of 3, which is 15 flowers, and then 1 pack of 2, which is 2 flowers. That would be 17 flowers. Then he needs one more flower. But he can't buy a single flower, only in packs. So he would have to buy another 2-pack, making it 19 flowers. That would be 5*3 + 2*2 = 15 + 4 = 19 flowers. The cost would be 5*2.50 + 2*1 = 12.50 + 2 = $14.50. Which is more than $9, so worse than buying all 2-packs. Alternatively, if he buys 6 packs of 3 (18 flowers) for $15, which is more than $9. So definitely, buying all 2-packs is cheaper.\n\nAlternatively, if he buys 8 packs of 2 (16 flowers) and then one 2-pack is 16, but he needs 18. So 8 packs of 2 is 16, then he needs 2 more, which is another 2-pack. So that's 9 packs total, which is 18 flowers. So that's the same as before. So no, there's no cheaper way than buying all 2-packs. Therefore, the savings are $15 - $9 = $6.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the per-flower cost again. The 2-pack is $1 for 2 flowers, so $0.50 per flower. The 3-pack is $2.50 for 3 flowers, which is approximately $0.833 per flower. So yes, the 2-pack is cheaper. Therefore, buying all 2-packs is the better deal. So the total cost is $9, and the other option is $15, so the saving is $6. That seems right.\n\nI think that's the answer. But let me just check once more. 18 flowers in 2-packs: 18 divided by 2 is 9. 9 times $1 is $9. 18 flowers in 3-packs: 18 divided by 3 is 6. 6 times $2.50 is $15. Difference is $6. Yep, that's correct. So Vincent saves $6 by buying the 2-packs instead of the 3-packs.\n</think>\n\nVincent kann 18 Blumen entweder in 2-er-Packungen (je 1,00 $) oder in 3-er-Packungen (je 2,50 $) kaufen. \n\n**Berechnung des günstigsten Preises:**\n- **2-er-Packungen:**  \n  Für 18 Blumen benötigt er $ \\frac{18}{2} = 9 $ Packungen.  \n  Gesamtkosten: $ 9 \\times 1,00 = 9,00 $ $.\n\n- **3-er-Packungen:**  \n  Für 18 Blumen benötigt er $ \\frac{18}{3} = 6 $ Packungen.  \n  Gesamtkosten: $ 6 \\times 2,50 = 15,00 $ $.\n\n**Ersparnis:**  \n$ 15,00 - 9,00 = 6,00 $ $.\n\n**Antwort:** Vincent spart **6,00 US-Dollar**."]], "filtered_resps": ["6,00"], "doc_hash": "906f7400201a8ab5bb1fa82731f55ea80fe396f02c826798046977c6e024448c", "prompt_hash": "cf98496c219f92ca1678e63ccc25f882232547fe14c3ebf0dcf8e3bab3f19754", "target_hash": "e7f6c011776e8db7cd330b54174fd76f7d0216b612387a5ffcfb81e6f0919683", "exact_match": 0.0}

So, 30% off of $100. To calculate 30% of $100, I can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100. That would be 0.30. Then multiply that by the original price: 100 * 0.30 = 30.

The problem says Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than four times Grace's weight. I need to find out how much they weigh together. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Grace's weight is given directly: 125 pounds. That's straightforward. Now, Alex's weight is a bit more complex. It says Alex weighs 2 pounds less than four times Grace's weight. So, I need to calculate four times Grace's weight first and then subtract 2 pounds from that result.\n\nLet me write that out mathematically. Four times Grace's weight would be 4 multiplied by 125. Let me do that multiplication. 4 times 100 is 400, and 4 times 25 is 100, so adding those together gives 500. So, four times Grace's weight is 500 pounds. Then, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so I subtract 2 from 500. That would be 500 minus 2, which is 498 pounds. So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.\n\nNow, to find their combined weight, I need to add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together. Grace is 125 pounds, and Alex is 498 pounds. Adding those together: 125 plus 498. Let me do that addition. 125 plus 400 is 525, and then adding the remaining 98 gives 525 + 98. Hmm, 525 + 98 is the same as 525 + 100 - 2, which is 625 - 2 = 623. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 125 + 498. Breaking it down: 100 + 400 = 500, 25 + 98 = 123. Then 500 + 123 = 623. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, Grace and Alex together weigh 623 pounds. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Four times 125 is indeed 500, subtract 2 gives 498 for Alex. Then 125 + 498: 125 + 498.

The problem is about a football team that played 22 games. They have 8 more wins than losses. The question is asking how many games they won. Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out the number of wins.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information. The total number of games played is 22. That includes both wins and losses. Let me denote the number of losses as L. Then, according to the problem, the number of wins is 8 more than the number of losses. So, if I let W represent the number of wins, then W = L + 8.\n\nSince the total games are the sum of wins and losses, I can write the equation: W + L = 22. But I already have W in terms of L, so I can substitute that into the equation. Substituting W = L + 8 into the total games equation gives me (L + 8) + L = 22. Let me simplify that: 2L + 8 = 22.\n\nNow, solving for L. Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 22 - 8, which is 14. Then divide both sides by 2: L = 7. So the number of losses is 7. Then, since the number of wins is 8 more than losses, W = 7 + 8 = 15. Therefore, the team won 15 games.\n\nWait, let me check if that makes sense. If they have 15 wins and 7 losses, that adds up to 22 games, which matches the total given. And 15 is indeed 8 more than 7. So that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was setting up the equations properly and solving for the variables. Yeah, that should be it.\n</think>\n\nDas Fußballteam hat insgesamt 22 Spiele gespielt.

The question is about Gene making a quilt from old T-shirts from his vacations. Each T-shirt is a different vacation, and each row of the quilt is made from shirts of different years. He goes on vacation four times a year, and he's been traveling since he was 23. Now he's 34. How many quilt sections does he have in total?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many years he's been going on vacation. He started at 23 and is now 34. So, 34 minus 23 is 11 years. Wait, but does that include both the starting and ending years? Let me think. If he started at 23, that's his first year of traveling. Then each subsequent year until 34. So from 23 to 34 inclusive, that's 34 - 23 + 1 = 12 years. Wait, that's a common mistake. For example, from 23 to 24 is 2 years, right? 24 -23 +1 = 2. So yes, 34 -23 +1 = 12 years.\n\nNow, each year he goes on vacation four times. So per year, he has 4 T-shirts. So total number of T-shirts would be 12 years multiplied by 4 vacations per year. That's 12 * 4 = 48 T-shirts. Each T-shirt is a separate section of the quilt. So the total number of quilt sections is 48. But wait, the question says each row is made from sections of different years. But each T-shirt is a section, and each row is from a different year. Wait, maybe I need to check if the rows are per year or per vacation. Wait, the problem says: \"Jede Reihe ist aus Abschnitten eines anderen Ferienjahrs gefertigt.\" So each row is made from sections of a different vacation year. So each row corresponds to a single year. But each year he has four vacations, so each year would have four sections (T-shirts) in one row? Or is each vacation a separate row?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Jedes Shirt bildet einen eigenen Deckenabschnitt. Jede Reihe ist aus Abschnitten eines anderen Ferienjahrs gefertigt.\" So each shirt is a separate section. Each row is made from sections (shirts) of a different vacation year. So each row is from one year, and each row has as many sections as the number of vacations in that year. Since he goes on four vacations per year, each row (for a given year) would have four sections. But the question is asking for the total number of sections. So if he has 12 years, each with four sections, that's 12 * 4 = 48 sections. So the answer is 48.\n\nBut let me double-check. The key points: he started at 23, now 34. So 34 -23 = 11 years, but since he started at 23, that's the first year, so 12 years total. Each year, four vacations, so 4 T-shirts per year. 12 *4 =48. So yes, 48 sections. Therefore, the answer should be 48.\n</think>\n\nGene hat seit 23 Jahren bis zu seinem 34. Lebensjahr verreist, was **12 Jahre** entspricht (34 - 23 + 1).

Greg has an alarm that goes off three times a day. Each time it goes off, it rings until he turns it off. Today, the first time it went off, it rang four times. The second time, it rang three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang half as long as the second time. The question is, how many times did the alarm ring in total?\n\nHmm, wait. The problem mentions \"how often the alarm has rung\" in total. But the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nFirst, when the alarm went off the first time, it rang four times. So that's four rings. Then, the second time it went off, it rang three times as long as the first time. Wait, does that mean the duration was three times longer, or the number of rings was three times? The original says \"dreimal so lange geklingelt wie beim ersten Mal.\" \"So lange\" means \"as long,\" so the duration. So the second time, the alarm rang for three times the duration of the first time. But how does that translate to the number of rings?\n\nWait, but the first time, it rang four times. If the duration is three times longer, but the number of rings depends on the duration. If the alarm rings at a certain frequency, say, once per second, then longer duration would mean more rings. But the problem doesn't specify the frequency. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using \"klingelt\" in the sense of the number of times it rings, not the duration. Let me check the original German again: \"Als er heute zum ersten Mal losging, hat er viermal geklingelt.\" So \"viermal geklingelt\" means \"rang four times.\" Then, \"beim zweiten Mal... dreimal so lange geklingelt wie beim ersten Mal.\" \"So lange\" is duration, but maybe in this context, it's being used to mean the number of times? That might be a translation issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"so lange\" here refers to the number of rings. For example, if the first time it rang four times, the second time it rang three times as long, meaning three times the number of rings. But that would be \"dreimal so oft geklingelt,\" not \"so lange.\" Hmm.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me think again. If the alarm rings for a certain duration each time, and the number of rings depends on the duration. But without knowing the rate (how many rings per second), we can't calculate the exact number. However, maybe the problem is using \"so lange\" to mean the number of rings. For example, if the first time it rang four times, the second time it rang three times as long, meaning three times the number of rings, so 4 * 3 = 12 rings. Then the third time, half as long as the second time, so 12 / 2 = 6 rings. Total would be 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 rings.\n\nBut that's assuming that \"so lange\" refers to the number of rings, which might not be accurate. Alternatively, if \"so lange\" refers to duration, but the number of rings is proportional to the duration. However, without knowing the rate, we can't compute the exact number. But maybe the problem is using \"so lange\" to mean the number of rings, even though that's not the standard usage. In that case, the answer would be 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in German, and \"so lange\" is being used in a way that's equivalent to \"so oft\" (so often). Maybe a translation error. If that's the case, then the answer would be 22. But I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the duration, but the number of rings is the same each time. Wait, but the first time it rang four times, so maybe each time it rings four times, but the duration is different. But that doesn't make sense. If the alarm rings for a certain duration, the number of rings would depend on how long it rings. For example, if it rings once per second, then a longer duration would mean more rings. But without knowing the rate, we can't calculate. However, maybe the problem is assuming that the number of rings is the same as the duration in some unit. For example, if the first time it rang for four seconds, with one ring per second, so four rings. Then the second time, three times as long, so 12 seconds, hence 12 rings. Third time, half as long as the second, so 6 seconds, 6 rings. Total 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.\n\nBut this is making an assumption about the rate. However, given that the first time it's stated as \"viermal geklingelt,\" which is four times, and if we take that as the number of rings, then the second time being three times as long would mean three times the number of rings. So that would be 4 * 3 = 12, and third time half of that, 6. Total 22.\n\nAlternatively, if \"so lange\" refers to the duration, but the number of rings is fixed, but that doesn't make sense because the first time it rang four times, so maybe the duration is four units, and the second time three times longer, so 12 units, but the number of rings would still be four? That seems odd.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but in typical math problems, when they say something like \"three times as long,\" and the first time is four rings, they might be implying that the number of rings is three times as many. So I think the answer is 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.\n</think>\n\nGreg's Wecker klingelt insgesamt **22 Mal**. \n\n**Berechnung:**  \n- **Erster Weckruf:** 4 Mal.  \n- **Zweiter Weckruf:** Dreimal so lange wie der erste → $4 \\times 3 = 12$ Mal.  \n- **Dritter Weckruf:** Halb so lange wie der zweite → $12 \\div 2 = 6$ Mal.  \n\n**Gesamt:** $4 + 12 + 6 = 22$.  \n\n**Antwort:** $\\boxed{22}$"]], "filtered_resps": ["22"], "doc_hash": "5135e12183ea030b75f7e04cf2b0905c6349c0570b3628dcb5dcca43f0c69380", "prompt_hash": "e26af1b979e86229d2aba080d73b79baa45927560bcbaa501414066bf9d8fdd1", "target_hash": "785f3ec7eb32f30b90cd0fcf3657d388b5ff4297f2f9716ff66e9b69c05ddd09", "exact_match": 1.0}

So, I need to figure out her salary after three more years.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify the timeline. Sylvie has been with the company for five years as of last December. So, if we're talking about \"after three more years,\" that would be three years from now, right? Wait, but when is the current time? The question says \"im letzten Dezember\" which is \"last December\" in German. So, if Sylvie was with the company for exactly five years in last December, then the current time is now, and we need to calculate her salary after three more years from now. But I need to make sure about the exact timing.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as: Sylvie was with the company for exactly five years in December (last December), and now we need to calculate her salary after three more years. So, the time frame is from when she had five years of service (last December) to three years after that. So, that would be three years from the time she had five years of service. But the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Ein Unternehmen zahlt jedem seiner Mitarbeiter 600 US-Dollar pro Monat. Das Unternehmen betreibt eine Unternehmenspolitik, bei der das Gehalt aller Mitarbeiter um 10 % des Ursprungsgehalts für diejenigen angehoben wird, die seit fünf Jahren im Unternehmen sind. Wenn Sylvie im letzten Dezember genau 5 Jahre im Unternehmen war, ist ihr Gehalt nach weiteren drei Jahren wie hoch?\"\n\nSo, the company pays each employee $600 per month. The policy is that for those who have been with the company for five years, their salary is increased by 10% of the original salary. Sylvie was with the company for exactly five years in last December. What is her salary after three more years?\n\nSo, the key points:\n\n- Base salary: $600/month.\n\n- Policy: 10% of original salary increase for those with five years of service.\n\n- Sylvie had five years of service in last December. Now, we need to find her salary after three more years. So, three years after she had five years of service. That would mean she has 5 + 3 = 8 years of service now. But does the salary increase happen once when she reaches five years, and then remains the same? Or does it increase every year after that?\n\nThe policy says \"für diejenigen angehoben wird, die seit fünf Jahren im Unternehmen sind.\" So, the increase is applied to those who have been with the company for five years. So, once they reach five years, their salary is increased by 10% of the original salary. So, it's a one-time increase when they hit five years. Then, after that, their salary remains at the increased amount unless there's another policy. The question doesn't mention any further increases, so I think it's a one-time increase.\n\nTherefore, Sylvie's salary was increased by 10% of the original $600 when she reached five years. So, her salary after the increase would be $600 + 10% of $600 = $600 * 1.10 = $660 per month. Then, after three more years, her salary would still be $660 per month, because the policy only applies once when she reaches five years. Unless there's another policy that applies after that, but the question doesn't mention any. So, the answer would be $660 per month.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is asking for the salary after three more years from the time she had five years. So, if she had five years in December, then three years later would be December of the following three years. But the salary increase is already applied when she reached five years. So, after that, her salary is $660, and it doesn't change unless there's another increase. Since the problem doesn't mention any other increases, the answer is $660.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in German, and the translation might have nuances. Let me check the original German again:\n\n\"Das Unternehmen betreibt eine Unternehmenspolitik, bei der das Gehalt aller Mitarbeiter um 10 % des Ursprungsgehalts für diejenigen angehoben wird, die seit fünf Jahren im Unternehmen sind.\"\n\nSo, the policy is that the salary is increased by 10% of the original salary for those who have been with the company for five years. So, the increase is 10% of the original salary, not 10% of the current salary. So, if the original salary is $600, then the increase is $60, making it $660. That's a one-time increase when they reach five years. So, after that, the salary remains at $660. Therefore, after three more years, her salary is still $660.\n\nBut wait, maybe the question is asking for the salary after three more years from now, where \"now\" is the time when she had five years. So, if she had five years in December, and now we are in the present time (which is after December), but the question says \"nach weiteren drei Jahren\" which is \"after three more years.\" So, three years from the time she had five years. So, the increase was already applied when she reached five years, and then after three more years, her salary is still $660. So, the answer is $660 per month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in German, and \"nach weiteren drei Jahren\" could be interpreted as three years from now, but if \"now\" is the time when she had five years, then three years later. But the problem states that she was with the company for exactly five years in last December. So, if the current time is now, and we need to calculate her salary after three more years from now, but she already had five years in December. So, depending on when the current time is, but the problem is a bit ambiguous. However, the most straightforward interpretation is that the increase is applied once when she reaches five years, and then her salary remains at the increased amount. Therefore, after three more years, her salary is $660.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Suppose the company gives a 10% increase every year after five years. But the policy says \"für diejenigen angehoben wird, die seit fünf Jahren im Unternehmen sind.\" So, it's for those who have been with the company for five years. So, it's a one-time increase. So, once they reach five years, they get the increase. So, Sylvie got the increase in December when she had five years. Then, after three more years, she has eight years, but her salary is still $660. So, the answer is $660.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the salary after three more years of employment, starting from when she had five years. So, if she had five years in December, then three more years would be five + three = eight years. But the salary was increased once when she hit five years, so it's $660.

Since 1/4 of the guests aren't coming, that means 3/4 will come. Wait, the problem says she needs 0.75 gift bags per guest because 1/4 don't come. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. If 1/4 of the guests don't come, then she needs to prepare gift bags for the ones who do come. But the problem states she needs 0.75 per guest. Maybe that's because she's accounting for the no-shows by preparing fewer bags? Or is it that she needs 0.75 bags per guest, regardless of attendance? Wait, the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nLet me read it again: \"für jeden eingeladenen Gast 0,75 Geschenktüten, da 1/4 der Gäste nicht erscheint.\" So, \"for each invited guest 0.75 gift bags, because 1/4 of the guests don't come.\" So, maybe she's calculating that since 1/4 don't come, she needs 0.75 bags per invited guest. Wait, 1/4 is 0.25, so maybe she's adjusting the number of bags by that fraction? Let me think.\n\nIf she invited 16 guests, and 1/4 don't come, that's 16 * 1/4 = 4 guests not coming. So, 16 - 4 = 12 guests attending. If she needs to prepare gift bags for the attendees, that would be 12 bags. But the problem says she needs 0.75 bags per invited guest. So, 16 guests * 0.75 = 12 bags. Oh, that's the same as the other way. So, whether she calculates 1/4 of the guests not coming (so 3/4 attending) or multiplies the number of invited guests by 0.75, she gets 12. So, that's the number of gift bags needed.\n\nThen, each gift bag costs $2, so total cost is 12 * $2 = $24. So, the answer should be $24. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0.75 is because she needs to have some extra? But the problem says \"da 1/4 der Gäste nicht erscheint,\" which translates to \"because 1/4 of the guests don't come.\" So, she needs to prepare fewer bags than the number of invited guests. Since 1/4 don't come, she needs to prepare 3/4 of the invited guests' number. 3/4 is 0.75, so 16 * 0.75 = 12. Then 12 * $2 = $24. That seems right.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's another interpretation. For example, if she needs 0.75 bags per guest, regardless of attendance, but that would be 16 * 0.75 = 12, same as before. So either way, the calculation leads to 12 bags. So, the total cost is 12 * 2 = 24. So, $24. That seems straightforward. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nChristina plant eine Geburtstagsparty mit 16 eingeladenen Freunden.

Ted the T-Rex wants to bring potato salad to a dinosaur picnic. He needs to figure out how much to bring so everyone gets enough. The problem says that an adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad, and a juvenile eats half as much as an adult. There are 20 adults and 5 juveniles at the picnic. So, I need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for all of them.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. For the adults: each one eats 10 pounds. There are 20 adults. So, 20 adults multiplied by 10 pounds each. That would be 20 * 10. Let me do that math. 20 times 10 is 200. So, the adults need 200 pounds of potato salad.\n\nNow, the juveniles. Each juvenile eats half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 pounds, half of that is 5 pounds per juvenile. There are 5 juveniles. So, 5 juveniles multiplied by 5 pounds each. That's 5 * 5. Which is 25. So, the juveniles need 25 pounds.\n\nThen, to find the total amount Ted needs to bring, I add the amount for adults and juveniles together. That would be 200 pounds plus 25 pounds. 200 + 25 equals 225. So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that right. Adults: 20 * 10 = 200.

That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So Amy's age = Jackson's age + 5. Also, Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.

The problem is about Lee and Gerald running the 400-meter hurdles. I need to figure out how fast Gerald can run now after improving his diet. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, Lee can run the 400m hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. But then Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. Now, Lee's time is 38 seconds. The question is, how fast can Gerald run now with his improved speed?\n\nHmm. Let me start by understanding the original times before Gerald's diet change. Let's denote Gerald's original time as G. Then Lee's original time would be G - 2 seconds, right? Because Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Lee's time is now 38 seconds. Wait, does that mean Lee's time is 38 seconds after Gerald's diet change? Or is that Lee's original time? The wording is a bit confusing here. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Lee konnte die 400 Meter Hürdenlauf zwei Sekunden schneller laufen als Gerald die 400 Meter Hürden läuft. Gerald hat allerdings seine Ernährungsweise umgestellt, wodurch er seine Geschwindigkeit um 10 % verbessert hat. Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft, wie schnell kann dann Gerald, mit seiner verbesserten Ernährungsweise, die 400 Meter Hürden in Sekunden laufen?\"\n\nSo, the original statement is that Lee can run two seconds faster than Gerald. Then Gerald improved his speed by 10%. Now, Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, the 38 seconds is Lee's time after Gerald's improvement? Or is that Lee's original time?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft...\" which translates to \"If Lee runs the 400m hurdles in 38 seconds...\" So, this is Lee's current time. But when was Gerald's improvement? The problem says Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. So, the 38 seconds is Lee's time, and we need to find Gerald's time after his improvement.\n\nBut first, we need to figure out Gerald's original time. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet G be Gerald's original time (before diet change).\n\nThen Lee's original time would be G - 2 seconds.\n\nBut now, Gerald has improved his speed by 10%. So, his new time would be G * (1 - 0.10) = 0.9G? Wait, no. Wait, if speed increases by 10%, then time decreases. Because speed and time are inversely related. So, if speed increases by 10%, the time should decrease by a certain percentage.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Gerald hat seine Geschwindigkeit um 10 % verbessert\". So, his speed is now 1.1 times his original speed. Therefore, his time would be original time divided by 1.1, right? Because time is inversely proportional to speed.\n\nSo, if original speed is S, then new speed is 1.1S. Since time = distance / speed, original time is D/S, new time is D/(1.1S) = original time / 1.1. So, new time is original time multiplied by 1/1.1 ≈ 0.9091.\n\nBut the problem says Lee's time is 38 seconds. Wait, but when is that? Is Lee's time 38 seconds before or after Gerald's improvement? The problem says \"Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft...\" which is a hypothetical scenario. So, maybe Lee's time is 38 seconds, and we need to find Gerald's time after his improvement.\n\nBut how does that relate to the original statement that Lee was two seconds faster than Gerald?\n\nSo, originally, Lee's time was G - 2, where G is Gerald's original time. But now, Gerald has improved his speed, so his new time is G / 1.1. But Lee's time is now 38 seconds. Wait, but does Lee's time change? The problem doesn't say that Lee changed anything. So, maybe Lee's time is still G - 2, but the problem says that Lee's time is 38 seconds. Therefore, G - 2 = 38? Then G = 40 seconds. Then Gerald's original time was 40 seconds, and after improving his speed by 10%, his new time is 40 / 1.1 ≈ 36.36 seconds. So, the answer would be approximately 36.36 seconds, which is 36 and 4/11 seconds, or 36.36 seconds.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says Lee could run two seconds faster than Gerald. So, Lee's original time is Gerald's original time minus 2. Then, Gerald improves his speed by 10%, so his new time is original time divided by 1.1. Now, Lee's time is given as 38 seconds. But is that Lee's original time or his current time? The problem says \"Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft...\" which is a conditional statement. So, if Lee runs in 38 seconds, then what is Gerald's time? But does that mean that Lee's time is 38 seconds, which would be his original time? Or is there a change in Lee's time?\n\nWait, the problem doesn't mention Lee changing anything. So, if Lee's original time was G - 2, and now Lee's time is 38 seconds, then that would mean that G - 2 = 38, so G = 40. Therefore, Gerald's original time was 40 seconds. Then, after improving his speed by 10%, his new time is 40 / 1.1 ≈ 36.36 seconds. Therefore, the answer is approximately 36.36 seconds.\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't misinterpret the original relationship. The original statement is that Lee could run two seconds faster than Gerald. So, Lee's time is Gerald's time minus two. So, if Gerald's original time is G, Lee's original time is G - 2. Then, the problem says that Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, that would be Lee's original time? Or is that Lee's time after Gerald's improvement?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Wenn Lee die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden läuft...\" which is a hypothetical scenario. So, maybe Lee's time is 38 seconds, and we need to find Gerald's time after his improvement. But how does that relate to the original two seconds difference?\n\nWait, perhaps the original two seconds difference is still in effect. So, if Lee's time is 38 seconds, then Gerald's original time would be 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. Then, Gerald's improved time is 40 / 1.1 ≈ 36.36 seconds. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two seconds difference is after Gerald's improvement. But the problem says \"Lee konnte die 400 Meter Hürdenlauf zwei Sekunden schneller laufen als Gerald die 400 Meter Hürden läuft.\" So, the original statement is that Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald. Then Gerald improves his speed, and now we have Lee's time as 38 seconds. So, Lee's time hasn't changed, so Gerald's original time was 40 seconds, and after improvement, it's 40 / 1.1 ≈ 36.36 seconds.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 36.36 seconds, which can be written as 36.36 or as a fraction. Let me compute 40 divided by 1.1.\n\n40 / 1.1 = 400 / 11 ≈ 36.3636... So, approximately 36.36 seconds. Depending on how the answer should be presented, maybe as a fraction or decimal. The problem says \"in Sekunden\", so decimal is fine. But maybe they want it as a fraction. 400/11 is the exact value.\n\nBut let me check again. Let me rephrase the problem step by step.\n\n1. Original times: Lee's time = Gerald's original time - 2 seconds.\n\n2. Gerald improves his speed by 10%, so his new time is original time / 1.1.\n\n3. Now, Lee's time is given as 38 seconds. Assuming that Lee's time hasn't changed, then Lee's original time is 38 seconds. Therefore, from step 1: 38 = Gerald_original - 2 => Gerald_original = 40 seconds.\n\n4. Gerald's new time is 40 / 1.1 = 36.3636... seconds.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 36.36 seconds, or 36 and 4/11 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a different interpretation, but I don't see another way. The key is that Lee's time is 38 seconds, which is his original time, leading to Gerald's original time being 40 seconds, then after improvement, Gerald's time is 40 / 1.1.\n\nAnother way to think: If Gerald's speed increased by 10%, his time decreased by 1/1.1, which is approximately 9.09%. So, 40 seconds minus 9.09% of 40 is 40 - 3.636 = 36.364 seconds. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 36.36 seconds. But let me check if the question is in German, maybe there's a nuance I missed. The original problem says \"Lee konnte die 400 Meter Hürdenlauf zwei Sekunden schneller laufen als Gerald die 400 Meter Hürden läuft.\" So, \"could run two seconds faster than Gerald runs the 400m hurdles.\" So, that's the original comparison. Then Gerald improved his speed, and now Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, Lee's time is 38, which is the same as before, so Gerald's original time was 40, and now with 10% faster speed, his time is 40 / 1.1.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer is 400/11 seconds, which is approximately 36.36 seconds.\n</think>\n\nLee läuft die 400 Meter Hürden in 38 Sekunden.

I need to figure out the total number of pets in the neighborhood. The problem says that the number of rabbits is twelve times less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Also, for every dog, there are two cats, and there are 60 dogs. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note down the given information:\n\n1. Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) / 12\n2. For every dog, there are two cats. So, the ratio of dogs to cats is 1:2.\n3. There are 60 dogs.\n\nAlright, starting with the dogs. Since there are 60 dogs, and the ratio of dogs to cats is 1:2, that means for each dog, there are two cats. So, the number of cats should be 2 times the number of dogs. Let me calculate that.\n\nNumber of cats = 2 * Number of dogs = 2 * 60 = 120 cats. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the combined number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180. So, the number of rabbits is twelve times less than this combined number. Wait, \"twelve times geringer\" – in German, \"geringer\" means less, so \"twelve times less\" would mean dividing by 12? Or is it subtracting twelve times? Hmm, sometimes \"times less\" can be ambiguous, but in math problems, it's usually interpreted as dividing. So, if something is twelve times less, it's the original amount divided by twelve. So, rabbits = (dogs + cats) / 12.\n\nSo, rabbits = 180 / 12 = 15. Let me check that. If the number of rabbits is twelve times less than the combined number of dogs and cats, then 15 * 12 = 180, which matches the combined number. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and rabbits. So, that's 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 15 (rabbits) = 60 + 120 is 180, plus 15 is 195. So, the total number of pets is 195.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the \"twelve times geringer\" part. If someone says \"A is twelve times less than B,\" does that mean A = B / 12 or A = B - 12*B? The latter would be a huge negative number, which doesn't make sense here. So, it's definitely A = B / 12. So, rabbits are 180 / 12 = 15. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If the number of rabbits is twelve times less than the combined number of dogs and cats, then the combined number is twelve times the number of rabbits. So, dogs + cats = 12 * rabbits. Which is the same as rabbits = (dogs + cats)/12. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, adding them all up: 60 + 120 + 15 = 195. That should be the total number of pets in the neighborhood. I think that's it. Let me just check once more.\n\nNumber of dogs: 60. Cats: 2 per dog, so 120. Rabbits: (60 + 120)/12 = 180/12 = 15. Total: 60 + 120 + 15 = 195. Yep, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nDie Anzahl der Hunde beträgt 60. Da auf jeden Hund zwei Katzen kommen, sind die Katzenanzahl $2 \\times 60 = 120$. Die kombinierte Anzahl von Hunden und Katzen ist $60 + 120 = 180$.

The problem says there are 200 students in the 5th grade. Out of these, 2/5 are boys, and 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. We need to find out how many girls are in the Girl Scouts.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many boys and how many girls there are in total. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, I can calculate the number of boys by multiplying 200 by 2/5. Let me do that: 200 times 2 is 400, divided by 5 is 80. So there are 80 boys.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, I can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. That would be 200 minus 80, which is 120. So there are 120 girls in total.\n\nNext, the problem states that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. So I need to calculate 2/3 of 120. Let me compute that: 120 divided by 3 is 40, and then multiplied by 2 gives 80. Therefore, 80 girls are in the Girl Scouts.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 2/3 of 120 is indeed (120 * 2)/3 = 240/3 = 80. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer should be 80.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. Total students 200, 2/5 are boys: 200*(2/5) = 80 boys. Girls are 200 - 80 = 120.

The last portion of sauce resulted in 32 ounces of sauce. The question is, how many tomatoes did Freda use?\n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how much the original tomatoes weighed before cooking, right? Because when they're cooked, they lose half their weight. So if the sauce is 32 ounces, that must be half of the original weight. Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nIf the tomatoes lose half their weight when cooked, then the weight of the sauce would be half of the original weight of the tomatoes. So if the sauce is 32 ounces, that means the original tomatoes must have been 64 ounces, because 64 divided by 2 is 32. Yeah, that makes sense. So the original weight of the tomatoes before cooking was 64 ounces.\n\nNow, each can is 16 ounces, and each can has three tomatoes. So how many cans did she use? If each can is 16 ounces, then 64 ounces divided by 16 ounces per can is 4 cans. So she used 4 cans. And each can has three tomatoes, so 4 cans times 3 tomatoes per can is 12 tomatoes.

The problem is about cars on a highway during a traffic jam. I need to figure out how many cars passed through the jam in the first 15 minutes. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nSo, originally, there are 30 cars on the highway. In the first 15 minutes of the jam, some cars go through. Then, in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam, 20 more cars go through. Also, 5 cars exit the queue, so they don't have to go through the jam. The question is asking how many cars went through the jam in the first 15 minutes.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The total number of cars initially is 30. Then, during the jam, some cars leave. But there are two time periods: first 15 minutes, then another 15 minutes. Wait, does the jam last 30 minutes total? Because first 15 minutes, then another 15 minutes. So the total jam duration is 30 minutes.\n\nIn the first 15 minutes, some cars go through. Let's call that number X. Then, in the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars go through. Additionally, 5 cars exit the queue, meaning they don't have to go through the jam. So, those 5 cars are subtracted from the total?\n\nWait, but how does that affect the count? If 5 cars exit the queue, they are no longer part of the jam. So, the total number of cars that went through the jam would be the ones that passed through in the first 15 minutes (X) plus the 20 in the next 15 minutes. But the original number of cars was 30. However, 5 cars left the queue, so maybe those 5 are not part of the ones that went through?\n\nWait, maybe the total number of cars that went through the jam is X + 20, and the 5 cars that exited the queue are separate. But the original number of cars was 30. So, if 5 cars exited the queue, then the remaining cars that had to go through the jam would be 30 - 5 = 25. Then, those 25 cars would be the ones that went through in the two time periods. So, X + 20 = 25? Therefore, X = 5?\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal cars: 30. 5 cars exit the queue, so they don't go through the jam. Therefore, the number of cars that actually went through the jam is 30 - 5 = 25. These 25 cars are split into two groups: those that went through in the first 15 minutes (X) and those that went through in the next 15 minutes (20). Therefore, X + 20 = 25, so X = 5. So the answer would be 5 cars in the first 15 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"in the first 15 minutes of the jam, some of the cars go through, then 20 more in the remaining 15 minutes.\" So maybe the total number of cars that went through is X + 20, and the 5 cars that exited are not counted in that total. Therefore, the original 30 cars minus the 5 that exited equals 25 cars that went through the jam. Therefore, X + 20 = 25, so X = 5. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 cars that exited are part of the original 30. So, if 5 cars left the queue, they are not part of the ones that went through. Therefore, the total number of cars that went through is 30 - 5 = 25. Then, those 25 are split into X and 20. So X = 5. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose the jam starts, and there are 30 cars. Then, during the first 15 minutes, X cars go through. Then, during the next 15 minutes, 20 cars go through. Additionally, 5 cars exit the queue. So, the total number of cars that went through the jam is X + 20. The 5 cars that exited are not part of that. Therefore, the original 30 cars minus the 5 that exited equals 25 cars that went through the jam. Therefore, X + 20 = 25, so X = 5. That seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 cars that exited are part of the ones that went through? But that doesn't make sense because if they exited the queue, they didn't have to go through the jam. So they are not counted in the number of cars that went through the jam. Therefore, the total number of cars that went through the jam is 30 - 5 = 25. Therefore, X + 20 = 25, so X = 5.\n\nYes, that seems to be the answer.

Mary is a passionate gardener. She got 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery yesterday. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window sills in her big country house. Now, she's feeling generous and wants to give 1 potted plant from each window sill to her friends and family tomorrow. The question is, how many potted plants will Mary have left after that?\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out how many potted plants she has in total before giving any away. She has 2 on each of the 40 window sills. So that's 2 multiplied by 40. Let me calculate that: 2 * 40 = 80. So she already has 80 potted plants on the window sills.\n\nThen, she received 18 new ones yesterday. So adding those to the existing ones, her total number of potted plants would be 80 + 18. Let me do that math: 80 + 18 = 98. So she has 98 potted plants in total.\n\nNow, she wants to give away 1 potted plant from each window sill. There are 40 window sills, so she's giving away 40 plants. Wait, but hold on. The problem says she has 2 plants on each of the 40 window sills. If she gives away 1 from each, that would mean she removes 1 from each of the 40 sills. So the number of plants she gives away is 40, right? Because each of the 40 sills loses 1 plant.\n\nSo, the total number of plants she has after giving away would be her original total (98) minus the 40 she gives away. Let me check that again. Original total is 80 (from the window sills) plus 18 new ones, which is 98. Then she gives away 40 plants. So 98 - 40 = 58. Therefore, she would have 58 plants left.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't misinterpret something. The problem says she has 2 plants on each of the 40 window sills. So that's 2*40=80. Then she gets 18 more. So total is 80+18=98. Then she gives away 1 from each of the 40 window sills. So she removes 1 from each of the 40 sills. So the number of plants given away is 40. Therefore, 98-40=58. That seems right.\n\nBut another way to think about it: After giving away 1 from each window sill, how many plants are left on the window sills? Originally, each had 2, so after giving away 1, each has 1 left. So 40 window sills * 1 plant each = 40 plants remaining on the sills. Then she also has the 18 new plants that she didn't place on the window sills. Wait, does the problem say where the 18 new plants are? The original statement says she got 18 new potted plants from the nursery. It doesn't specify if she placed them on the window sills or kept them elsewhere. Hmm, that's a possible ambiguity.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Sie hat bereits 2 Topfpflanzen auf jedem der 40 Fenstersimse ihres großen Landhauses stehen.\" So she already has 2 on each of the 40 window sills. Then she got 18 new ones. It doesn't say she put them on the window sills. So maybe the 18 are separate. So total plants would be the 80 on the window sills plus 18 new ones, totaling 98. Then she gives away 1 from each of the 40 window sills, so 40 plants. Therefore, remaining plants would be 98 - 40 = 58. But if the 18 new plants are also on the window sills, that would change things. But the problem doesn't say that. It just says she got 18 new ones. So unless specified, we can assume they are in addition to the ones on the window sills.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she added the 18 new plants to the window sills? But the problem doesn't state that. The original 2 per window sill are already there. The 18 are new, but it's not clear where they are. However, the problem says she is going to give away 1 from each window sill. So the 18 new plants are probably not on the window sills. Therefore, the total plants are 80 (on sills) + 18 (new) = 98. Then she gives away 40, so 58 left.\n\nBut let me check again. If the 18 new plants are on the window sills, then the total on the window sills would be 2*40 + 18 = 80 + 18 = 98. Then she gives away 1 from each of the 40 sills, so 40 plants. Then the remaining on the sills would be 98 - 40 = 58. But that would be if the 18 were added to the window sills. However, the problem doesn't say that. It just says she got 18 new ones. So unless she added them to the window sills, they might be in another place. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, this is a possible ambiguity.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Sie hat bereits 2 Topfpflanzen auf jedem der 40 Fenstersimse ihres großen Landhauses stehen. Ihr ist großzügig zumute und sie hat sich entschlossen, dass sie 1 Topfpflanze von jedem Fenstersims morgen an Freunde und Familie verschenken möchte.\"\n\nSo the key here is that she has 2 on each of the 40 window sills. The 18 new ones are separate. She is giving away 1 from each window sill. So the 18 are not on the window sills. Therefore, the total number of plants is 80 (on sills) + 18 (new) = 98. She gives away 40 (1 from each of the 40 sills), so 98 - 40 = 58. Therefore, the answer is 58.\n\nBut another way: If the 18 new plants are also on the window sills, then the total on the sills would be 2*40 + 18 = 98. Then she gives away 1 from each of the 40 sills, so 40 plants. Then the remaining on the sills would be 98 - 40 = 58. But that would be if the 18 were added to the window sills. However, the problem doesn't state that. It just says she got 18 new ones. So unless she added them to the window sills, they are separate. But the problem doesn't specify where the 18 are. This is a possible ambiguity.\n\nWait, but the problem says she has 2 on each of the 40 window sills. Then she got 18 new ones. It doesn't say she put them on the window sills. So the 18 are separate. Therefore, total plants are 80 + 18 = 98. She gives away 40, so 58 left. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the 18 new plants are on the window sills, then the total on the sills would be 2*40 + 18 = 98. Then she gives away 1 from each of the 40 sills, so 40 plants. Then the remaining on the sills would be 98 - 40 = 58. But that would be if the 18 were on the sills. However, the problem doesn't say that. So the answer is 58 either way, because whether the 18 are on the sills or not, the total plants are 80 + 18 = 98, and she gives away 40, so 58. Wait, no. If the 18 are on the sills, then the total on the sills is 80 + 18 = 98. Then she gives away 40, so remaining on the sills is 98 - 40 = 58. If the 18 are not on the sills, then total plants are 80 + 18 = 98, she gives away 40, so 58. Either way, the answer is 58. Because whether the 18 are on the sills or not, the total number of plants is 98, and she gives away 40. So the answer is 58.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 58.\n</think>\n\nMary hat bereits 2 Topfpflanzen auf jedem der 40 Fenstersimse, also $2 \\times 40 = 80$ Pflanzen.

Jerome has four friends visiting him, and each of them pressed the doorbell a certain number of times. The question is asking for the total number of times the doorbell rang. Let me break down the information step by step.\n\nFirst, the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. That's straightforward. So Friend 1: 20 times.\n\nNext, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more often than the first friend. Hmm, okay. Wait, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – in German, \"öfter\" means more often. So does that mean the second friend pressed it 1/4 times more than the first? Or is it 1/4 times as much? Wait, the wording is \"1/4 Mal öfter als Jeromes erster Freund.\" So \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – in English, that would be \"1/4 times more often.\" So if the first friend did 20 times, then the second friend did 20 plus 1/4 of 20? Or is it 1/4 times the amount of the first friend?\n\nWait, in German, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" can be a bit ambiguous. But usually, when something is \"x Mal öfter,\" it's x times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25? Or is it 1/4 times the original? That would be 5. But that seems less likely. Let me think. If someone says \"I have 2 apples, and you have 1/4 times more,\" does that mean 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 or 0.5? In English, \"times more\" is often interpreted as multiplying. So \"1/4 times more\" would be 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25. But I need to be careful here because sometimes people use \"times more\" to mean just the multiple, not the addition. But in German, maybe it's different? Wait, the original question is in German, so maybe the translation is important here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is meant to be 1/4 times as much. But that would be 20 * 1/4 = 5. But that seems like a big difference. Let me check the rest of the problem to see if that makes sense. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. The fourth friend pressed it 60 times. So third friend is 60 + 10 = 70? Wait, no, the problem says \"10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more? So if the fourth is 60, then third is 60 + 10*60 = 660? That seems extremely high. Wait, but maybe \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times as much. So third friend is 10 times the fourth. If fourth is 60, then third is 600. But the problem says \"10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10 times more often\" – which again, in German, could be 10 times as much. So if the fourth is 60, then third is 60 * 10 = 600. But that seems like a lot. However, maybe that's correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"der dritte Freund hat die Türklingel 10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 10 times more. So if the fourth pressed it 60 times, then the third pressed it 60 + 10*60 = 660? Or is it 10 times as much? That's the ambiguity again. In some contexts, \"10 times more\" is 10 times the original, but in others, it's original plus 10 times original. But in German, maybe it's more likely to be 10 times as much. For example, if you say \"10-mal so oft,\" that would be 10 times as often. But \"10-mal öfter\" might be 10 times more. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me see if there's a standard interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times the original. So for the second friend: 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25? Or 20 * 1/4 = 5? If the answer is 25, then the total would be 20 + 25 + ... but if it's 5, then the total would be different. Similarly for the third friend. Let me check the rest of the problem again.\n\nThe fourth friend pressed it 60 times. The third pressed it 10 times more than the fourth. If \"10 times more\" is 10 times as much, then third is 600. If it's 10 times more in addition, then 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems too high. However, given that the first friend is 20, second is 25 (if 1/4 more), third is 600, fourth is 60, total would be 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705. But maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, if the second friend is 5, third is 70, then total is 20 + 5 + 70 + 60 = 155. Which one is more plausible?\n\nWait, the problem says \"der zweite hat die Türklingel 1/4 Mal öfter betätigt als Jeromes erster Freund.\" So \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 1/4 times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. That seems more reasonable. Similarly, \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more, so third is 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems very high. However, maybe the problem is using \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times as much. So third is 10 * 60 = 600. Which is still high, but maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times the amount. So if the fourth is 60, then third is 60 * 10 = 600. Let's go with that for now. Then the total would be 20 (first) + 25 (second) + 600 (third) + 60 (fourth) = 705. But I need to confirm the interpretation of \"1/4 Mal öfter\" and \"10-mal öfter.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original. So second friend is 20 * 1/4 = 5. Then third friend is 10 times the fourth, which is 60 * 10 = 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685. But that's different. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times more, which is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. Similarly, \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times more, so 60 + 10*60 = 660. Then total is 20 + 25 + 660 + 60 = 765. But this is getting too high. However, the problem might be using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times the original, so 5, and \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times the original, so 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685. But I need to figure out the correct interpretation.\n\nIn German, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" – the phrase \"x Mal öfter\" is often used to mean \"x times as much\" or \"x times more.\" However, in some contexts, \"x Mal öfter\" can be ambiguous. For example, if someone says \"Ich habe 10 Mal öfter gegessen als du,\" it could mean \"I ate 10 times as much as you\" or \"I ate 10 times more than you.\" But in many cases, it's interpreted as \"x times as much.\" However, in some contexts, \"x times more\" is considered to be \"original + x*original,\" which is 1 + x times the original. But this is a common ambiguity in English as well.\n\nGiven that the problem is in German, and the answer is likely to be a whole number, let's try both interpretations and see which one gives a reasonable answer.\n\nFirst interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25\n- Friend 3: 10 times more than Friend 4: 60 + 10*60 = 660\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 25 + 660 + 60 = 765\n\nSecond interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25\n- Friend 3: 10 times as much as Friend 4: 60 * 10 = 600\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705\n\nThird interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 * 1/4 = 5\n- Friend 3: 10 times more than Friend 4: 60 + 10*60 = 660\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 5 + 660 + 60 = 745\n\nFourth interpretation:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 20 * 1/4 = 5\n- Friend 3: 10 times as much as Friend 4: 60 * 10 = 600\n- Friend 4: 60\nTotal: 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685\n\nBut which one is correct? Let's look at the exact wording again.\n\n\"Der zweite hat die Türklingel 1/4 Mal öfter betätigt als Jeromes erster Freund.\"\n\n\"1/4 Mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 1/4 times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. That's the first interpretation.\n\nSimilarly, \"der dritte Freund hat die Türklingel 10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more, so 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems very high. However, if \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times as much, then it's 600. Which is more likely?\n\nIn German, \"x-mal öfter\" is often used to mean \"x times as much.\" For example, \"Er hat es 10-mal öfter getan\" would mean \"He did it 10 times as much.\" But I'm not entirely sure. However, given that the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, and the third is 10 times more, if it's 10 times as much, then 600 is the answer. If it's 10 times more, then 660. But 660 seems extremely high, but maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"10-mal öfter\" as \"10 times the amount,\" so 600. Let's go with that for now. Then the total would be 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705.\n\nBut let's check if there's another way. Maybe \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original. So 20 * 1/4 = 5. Then the second friend is 5. Then the third is 10 times more than the fourth, which is 60 + 10*60 = 660. Then total is 20 + 5 + 660 + 60 = 745. But this seems inconsistent with the first part.\n\nAlternatively, if \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original, then the second friend is 5, and \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times the original, so third is 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to tell. However, in many math problems, when they say \"x times more,\" they usually mean x times the original amount. So \"1/4 times more\" would be 1/4 of the original, so 20 * 1/4 = 5. But that seems counterintuitive because \"more\" would imply addition. Wait, no. If you say \"1/4 times more,\" it's ambiguous. In some contexts, it's 1/4 of the original, but in others, it's original + 1/4 of original. This is a common ambiguity in English as well.\n\nGiven that, maybe the problem is using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times the original, so 5, and \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times the original, so 600. Then total is 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685. But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times more, which is 20 + 5 = 25, and \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times more, which is 60 + 600 = 660. Then total is 20 + 25 + 660 + 60 = 765.\n\nBut since the problem is in German, and I don't have the exact translation, it's hard to be 100% sure. However, in many math problems, when they say \"x times more,\" they mean x times the original. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 * (1 + 1/4) = 25. Similarly, the third is 60 * (1 + 10) = 660. But that would be 11 times the original. Wait, no. If it's \"10-mal öfter,\" then it's 10 times more, which would be 60 + 10*60 = 660. But if it's 10 times as much, it's 600.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's see:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n- Friend 1: 20\n- Friend 2: 1/4 Mal öfter als Friend 1\n- Friend 3: 10-mal öfter als Friend 4\n- Friend 4: 60\n\nSo if we can express Friend 2 and Friend 3 in terms of Friend 1 and Friend 4.\n\nFor Friend 2: If \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original, then Friend 2 = 20 * 1/4 = 5. If it's 1/4 times more, then Friend 2 = 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25.\n\nFor Friend 3: If \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times the original, then Friend 3 = 10 * 60 = 600. If it's 10 times more, then Friend 3 = 60 + 10*60 = 660.\n\nBut which is it? In German, \"x-mal öfter\" is often used to mean \"x times as much.\" For example, \"Er hat es 10-mal öfter getan\" would mean \"He did it 10 times as much.\" So in that case, Friend 3 would be 10 * 60 = 600. Similarly, \"1/4 Mal öfter\" would be 1/4 times as much, so Friend 2 = 20 * 1/4 = 5.\n\nBut that seems like a big difference. If Friend 2 is 5, then the total would be 20 + 5 + 600 + 60 = 685. But if Friend 2 is 25, then total is 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705.\n\nAlternatively, if \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times more, then Friend 2 is 25, and Friend 3 is 660, total 765.\n\nBut since the problem is in German, and I don't have the exact translation, I need to make an educated guess. In many math problems, especially in German, \"x-mal öfter\" is often used to mean \"x times as much,\" not \"x times more.\" So Friend 2 would be 5, Friend 3 would be 600. Then total is 685.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. However, given that the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, and the third is 10 times more, if it's 10 times as much, that's 600, which is a reasonable number. If it's 10 times more, that's 660, which is also possible. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, let's check the original problem again:\n\n\"Der zweite hat die Türklingel 1/4 Mal öfter betätigt als Jeromes erster Freund.\"\n\n\"1/4 Mal öfter\" – if \"öfter\" is \"more often,\" then it's 1/4 times more. So if the first is 20, then the second is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 25. That's the same as multiplying by 1.25. So 20 * 1.25 = 25.\n\nSimilarly, \"der dritte Freund hat die Türklingel 10-mal öfter betätigt als der vierte Freund.\" So \"10-mal öfter\" would be 10 times more, so 60 + 10*60 = 660. But that seems very high. However, if it's 10 times as much, then 600.\n\nBut in German, \"10-mal öfter\" is more likely to mean 10 times as much. For example, if you say \"Er hat es 10-mal öfter getan,\" it means he did it 10 times as much. So in that case, Friend 3 is 600.\n\nSo if Friend 2 is 25 and Friend 3 is 600, then total is 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 705.\n\nBut I'm still not 100% sure. However, given that the problem provides specific numbers, and if we take \"1/4 Mal öfter\" as 1/4 times more (25) and \"10-mal öfter\" as 10 times as much (600), then the total is 705. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if \"1/4 Mal öfter\" is 1/4 times the original (5), and \"10-mal öfter\" is 10 times as much (600), then total is 685. But I think the first interpretation is more likely, where \"1/4 Mal öfter\" means 1/4 times more, leading to 25.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 705.\n</think>\n\nJerome hat 4 Freunde, die die Türklingel unterschiedlich oft betätigten.

Solo has to read a bunch of pages from different books. The question is asking how many pages he needs to read on average each day for the next 4 days after already reading 15 pages on Monday. Hmm, first I need to figure out the total number of pages he needs to read in total.\n\nSo, the books are: 4 pages from the natural science book, 20 from social studies, 7 from history, and 8 from geography. Let me add those up. 4 + 20 is 24, plus 7 is 31, plus 8 makes 39. So total pages to read are 39?\n\nWait, but he already read 15 pages on Monday. So the remaining pages would be 39 minus 15. That's 24 pages left. Now, he has 4 days left to read these. So to find the average per day, I divide 24 by 4. That gives 6 pages per day. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I added the pages wrong. Let me recount: 4 (natural) + 20 (social) = 24. Then 24 + 7 (history) = 31. 31 + 8 (geography) = 39. Yes, that's correct. Then subtract the 15 he already read: 39 - 15 = 24. Divided by 4 days: 24 / 4 = 6. So the answer should be 6 pages per day. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"noch 4 Tage hat, um alles zu lesen.\" So after Monday, he has 4 more days. So total days from Monday onwards? Wait, does Monday count as the first day? The question says he read 15 pages on Monday, and then has 4 more days. So total days would be Monday plus 4 days, making 5 days in total? Wait, but the question is phrased as \"Wenn er noch 4 Tage hat, um alles zu lesen,\" which translates to \"If he still has 4 days to read everything.\" So maybe Monday is already done, and he has 4 more days. So the 15 pages were read on Monday, and then he has 4 days left. So the remaining pages are 24, divided by 4 days, which is 6. That seems right. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure there's no trick here. The total pages are definitely 4+20+7+8=39. He read 15 on Monday, so 39-15=24 left. 24 divided by 4 days is 6. Yep, that seems straightforward.

I need to figure out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says John drinks a glass of water at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Then, he has another one before bed. So that's four times a day, right? Wait, but the question is about the entire week, so I need to calculate per day and then multiply by the number of days in a week, considering the weekends are different.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that on weekdays, he drinks water at all those times, but on weekends, he replaces the evening glass with lemonade. So, on weekends, he doesn't have water before bed, but instead has lemonade. So, the key is to calculate the number of glasses on weekdays and weekends separately.\n\nLet me confirm: Weekdays are Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. On each of these days, he drinks 4 glasses: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed. So 4 glasses per weekday day.\n\nThen, weekends are Saturday and Sunday, 2 days. On these days, he still has breakfast, lunch, and dinner with water, but instead of the before-bed water, he has lemonade. So that's 3 glasses per weekend day.\n\nSo total for weekdays: 5 days * 4 glasses = 20 glasses.\n\nTotal for weekends: 2 days * 3 glasses = 6 glasses.\n\nAdding them together: 20 + 6 = 26 glasses per week.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says he drinks a glass at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Then, before bed, he has another one. So that's 4 times a day. But on weekends, he replaces the evening glass (which is before bed) with lemonade. So on weekends, he still has the three meals, but not the before-bed water. So yes, 3 glasses on weekends.\n\nSo 5 days * 4 = 20, 2 days * 3 = 6. Total 26. That seems right. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should check if the problem counts the evening as part of the dinner or separate. The problem says \"zum Abendessen\" which is dinner, and then \"vor dem Zubettgehen\" which is before bed. So dinner is separate from the before-bed glass. So yes, that's four times a day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed. So on weekdays, 4, weekends 3. So 5*4=20, 2*3=6, total 26.

The problem is about a fog bank moving from the sea towards a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. The city extends 42 miles from the coast to the inland. The question is, how many minutes will it take for the fog to cover the entire city?\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out the speed of the fog bank. If it covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, then the speed is 3 miles per 10 minutes. To make it easier, maybe convert that to miles per minute. So 3 miles divided by 10 minutes is 0.3 miles per minute. Wait, or is it better to think in terms of time per mile? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, if the fog moves 3 miles in 10 minutes, then the rate is 3/10 miles per minute, which is 0.3 miles per minute. So, to cover 42 miles, how long would that take? Time equals distance divided by speed. So time = 42 miles / 0.3 miles per minute. Let me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.3. Hmm, 0.3 times 140 is 42, right? Because 0.3 times 100 is 30, 0.3 times 40 is 12, so 30 + 12 = 42. So 140 minutes. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the question is about the entire city. The city is 42 miles long from the coast to inland. The fog is coming from the sea, so it starts at the coast and moves inland. So the first 3 miles take 10 minutes. Then, each subsequent 3 miles would take another 10 minutes? Wait, but that would be if the speed is constant. But if the speed is 3 miles per 10 minutes, then the time to cover 42 miles would be (42 / 3) * 10 minutes. That's 14 * 10 = 140 minutes. So that's the same answer as before. So both methods give 140 minutes.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. The fog is moving over the city, which is 42 miles long. The fog starts at the sea, so the first 3 miles take 10 minutes. Then, the next 3 miles would take another 10 minutes, and so on. So for 42 miles, how many 3-mile segments are there? 42 divided by 3 is 14. So 14 segments, each taking 10 minutes. 14 * 10 = 140 minutes. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the fog is moving at a constant speed, then the time is directly proportional to the distance. So if 3 miles take 10 minutes, then 1 mile takes 10/3 minutes, and 42 miles would take 42*(10/3) = 140 minutes. Yep, same result.\n\nI think that's solid.

The question is, how many pieces are left to be placed?\n\nAlright, starting with the total number of pieces, which is 1000. Poppy lays out a quarter of them. So, a quarter of 1000 is... let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 4 is 250. So she places 250 pieces. That means the remaining pieces after Poppy's turn would be 1000 minus 250, which is 750 pieces left.\n\nThen, her mom comes in and places a third of the remaining pieces. The remaining pieces at that point are 750. So a third of 750 is... 750 divided by 3. Let me do that. 750 divided by 3 is 250. So her mom adds 250 pieces. \n\nNow, to find out how many pieces are left to be placed, we need to subtract the pieces that have already been placed by both Poppy and her mom from the total. So, Poppy placed 250, mom placed 250, so together they've placed 250 + 250 = 500 pieces. \n\nTotal pieces are 1000, so 1000 minus 500 is 500. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst step: 1/4 of 1000 is 250. Correct. Remaining: 750. Then, mom does 1/3 of 750, which is 250. So total placed is 250 + 250 = 500. Therefore, remaining is 1000 - 500 = 500. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, maybe I should approach it step by step again.\n\nAlternatively, after Poppy places 250, there are 750 left. Then mom places 1/3 of those 750, which is 250. So after mom, the remaining pieces would be 750 - 250 = 500. So that's the same result. So the answer is 500 pieces left. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Maybe I confused the fractions. Let me write it down:\n\nTotal pieces: 1000\n\nPoppy places 1/4: 1000 * 1/4 = 250. Remaining: 1000 - 250 = 750.\n\nMom places 1/3 of the remaining: 750 * 1/3 = 250.

The problem says that Cody eats three times more cookies than Amir. If Amir eats 5 cookies, how many cookies do they both eat together?\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out how many cookies Cody eats. The key part here is \"dreimal mehr Kekse als Amir,\" which translates to \"three times more cookies than Amir.\" So, if Amir eats 5, then Cody eats 3 times that amount. Let me calculate that: 3 times 5 is 15. So Cody eats 15 cookies.\n\nNow, to find out how many they both eat together, I just need to add Amir's cookies and Cody's cookies. Amir has 5, Cody has 15. Adding them together: 5 + 15 equals 20. So the total should be 20 cookies.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I interpreted \"dreimal mehr\" correctly. Sometimes in German, \"mehr\" can be tricky. If it's \"three times as many as,\" that's straightforward multiplication. But if it's \"three times more than,\" does that mean 3 times the original plus the original? Like, if Amir has 5, then three times more would be 5 + 3*5 = 20? But that would be different. Wait, but in English, \"three times more\" is often used to mean three times as much, but sometimes people interpret it as the original plus three times, which would be four times. But in German, does \"dreimal mehr\" mean three times as much or three times more than?\n\nHmm, maybe I should check that. In German, \"dreimal mehr\" is usually interpreted as three times as much, not three times more than. So if Amir has 5, then Cody has 3*5 = 15. So the total would be 5 + 15 = 20. But if it were \"dreimal so viele wie Amir,\" that would be the same as \"three times as many as Amir,\" which is 15. So I think the original translation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 20.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider both interpretations. If \"dreimal mehr\" is taken as \"three times more than,\" meaning 5 + 3*5 = 20, then Cody would have 20, and together they would have 20 + 5 = 25. But that seems like a stretch. In most contexts, \"dreimal mehr\" would be three times the amount, not three times more than. So I think the correct answer is 20.\n</think>\n\nCody isst dreimal so viele Kekse wie Amir.

John has three boxes, and each one is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. But the walls are 1 inch thick. I need to find the total internal volume of all three boxes combined. Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to figure out the internal dimensions of each box, then calculate the volume for one, and multiply by three. But wait, how exactly do the walls affect the internal dimensions?\n\nAlright, the walls are 1 inch thick. So each side of the box has walls that take up space. For example, if the box is 5 inches in one dimension, but the walls are 1 inch thick on both sides, then the internal length in that dimension would be 5 inches minus twice the wall thickness, right? Because there's a wall on both ends. So for each dimension, I subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) to get the internal measurement.\n\nLet me confirm that. If the box is, say, 5 inches long, and the walls are 1 inch thick on both ends, then the inside length would be 5 - 2*1 = 3 inches. Yeah, that makes sense. Similarly for the other dimensions. So the original dimensions are 5x6x4, but the internal dimensions would be (5-2)*(6-2)*(4-2) = 3x4x2. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check each dimension again. The original box is 5 inches in one side, 6 in another, and 4 in the third. The walls are 1 inch thick. So for each of the three dimensions, the internal length would be original length minus twice the wall thickness. Because each wall is on both sides. So yes, 5 - 2*1 = 3, 6 - 2*1 = 4, 4 - 2*1 = 2. So the internal volume of one box is 3*4*2 = 24 cubic inches. Then three boxes would be 24*3 = 72 cubic inches. Is that the answer?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem says the walls are 1 inch thick. So for each dimension, the internal length is original length minus 2 inches (since walls are on both sides). So for example, if the box is 5 inches long, then the internal length is 5 - 2*1 = 3 inches. Similarly for the other dimensions. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the walls are only on the sides, but not on the top and bottom? Wait, no, the walls are the sides of the box. So a box has length, width, and height. Each of these dimensions has walls on both ends. So for each dimension, you subtract 2 inches. So the internal dimensions are (5-2) x (6-2) x (4-2) = 3x4x2. Then volume is 3*4*2 = 24. Multiply by three boxes: 24*3 = 72. So the total internal volume is 72 cubic inches.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to interpret the wall thickness. For example, if the walls are 1 inch thick, does that mean that each wall is 1 inch, so that the internal dimensions are original minus 2 inches in each direction? Yes, that's the standard way to calculate internal volume when given external dimensions and wall thickness. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the box is 5x6x4, and the walls are 1 inch thick, then the internal dimensions would be 5 - 2*1 = 3, 6 - 2*1 = 4, 4 - 2*1 = 2. So 3x4x2. So each box's internal volume is 24, three boxes would be 72. That seems right.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is in the units? The question says \"Wie groß ist das Innenvolumen aller 3 Kisten zusammen?\" which is German for \"How big is the total internal volume of all 3 boxes together?\" So the answer should be in cubic inches, right? The original dimensions are in inches, so the answer is 72 cubic inches. So I think that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't miscalculate anything.\n\nOriginal dimensions: 5x6x4. Subtract 2 inches from each dimension for internal: 3x4x2. Volume per box: 3*4*2 = 24. Three boxes: 24*3 = 72. Yep, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes here.

I need to figure out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. The total time he spent watching TV is 7 hours. Let me break down each day's viewing time step by step.\n\nFirst, Monday and Tuesday. Each day he watched a 1-hour episode. So that's 1 hour on Monday and 1 hour on Tuesday. That adds up to 2 hours total for those two days.\n\nThen, Wednesday. He watched some 30-minute episodes. Let me note that as x episodes. Since each is 30 minutes, that would be 0.5 hours per episode. So total time on Wednesday is 0.5x hours.\n\nThursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. So that's 1 hour plus 0.5 hours, which equals 1.5 hours on Thursday.\n\nFriday, he watched two 1-hour episodes. That's 2 hours on Friday.\n\nNow, adding up all the days: Monday (1) + Tuesday (1) + Wednesday (0.5x) + Thursday (1.5) + Friday (2) = total of 7 hours.\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\n1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\n\nAdding up the numbers first: 1 + 1 is 2, plus 1.5 is 3.5, plus 2 is 5.5. So:\n\n5.5 + 0.5x = 7\n\nSubtract 5.5 from both sides:\n\n0.5x = 7 - 5.5 = 1.5\n\nThen, solving for x:\n\nx = 1.5 / 0.5 = 3\n\nSo, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nMonday: 1h, Tuesday: 1h, Wednesday: 3 * 0.5h = 1.5h, Thursday: 1.5h, Friday: 2h. Total: 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours. Yep, that adds up.

Henry is baking cookies for a regional competition. He wants to bake twice as many as last year. But then he ends up with 15 more than he intended. Then he drops 5, and now he has 110. Need to find out how many he baked last year.\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. Let me define variables. Let me call the number of cookies he baked last year as x. So, this year he wanted to bake twice that, so 2x. But he ended up baking 15 more than he wanted, so that would be 2x + 15. Then he drops 5, so subtract 5 from that amount, and that equals 110. So the equation would be:\n\n2x + 15 - 5 = 110\n\nWait, let me check that again. He baked 2x +15, then dropped 5, so total is 2x +15 -5 = 110. Simplify that:\n\n2x +10 = 110\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n2x = 100\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx = 50\n\nSo last year he baked 50 cookies. Let me verify that.\n\nIf last year he baked 50, this year he wanted to do twice that, so 100. But he baked 15 more, so 115. Then he dropped 5, so 115 -5 = 110. Yep, that matches the given total. So that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem says he \"bemerkt, dass er 15 Kekse mehr gebacken hat als er eigentlich wollte.\" So he realized he had 15 more than he wanted. So the intended amount was 2x, but he actually baked 2x +15. Then he drops 5, so 2x +15 -5 = 110. Which gives 2x +10 = 110, so 2x = 100, x=50. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think: After dropping 5, he has 110. So before dropping, he had 115. And that 115 is 15 more than he wanted. So he wanted 115 -15 = 100. Which is twice last year's amount. So last year's amount is 50. Yep, same answer. So I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nHenry wollte dieses Jahr doppelt so viele Kekse backen wie letztes Jahr.

The problem is about calculating the cost of gasoline after a rebate. So, the local gas station sells gasoline at $3.00 per gallon. The app company offers a $20 rebate if you buy gas there. The question is, if someone buys 10 gallons, how much does the gasoline cost after the rebate?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total cost without the rebate. That would be the price per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons. So, $3.00 per gallon times 10 gallons. Let me calculate that: 3 * 10 = $30.00. So, the total cost before any rebate is $30.\n\nNow, the app company gives a $20 rebate. A rebate is like a discount or a refund, right? So, if you buy the gas at the station, you get $20 back. So, the total cost after the rebate would be the original total cost minus the rebate. That would be $30 - $20 = $10.00.\n\nWait, but is the rebate per gallon or a flat amount? The problem says \"a $20 rebate if you buy gas there.\" So, it's a flat $20, not per gallon. So regardless of how many gallons you buy, you get $20 back. So, even if you buy 10 gallons, you still get $20. So, the calculation is correct: $30 total minus $20 rebate equals $10.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe the rebate is per gallon? The question says \"20 US-Dollar an, wenn du an dieser Tankstelle tankst.\" So, the wording is \"a refund of $20 if you buy gas there.\" So, it's a flat $20, not per gallon. So, the answer should be $10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rebate is per gallon? But the problem doesn't specify that. It just says $20. So, I think it's a flat $20. Therefore, the total cost after rebate is $30 - $20 = $10.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes rebates are applied per transaction, so if you buy 10 gallons, you get $20 back. So, the effective price per gallon would be ($30 - $20)/10 = $10/10 = $1.00 per gallon. But the question is asking \"wie viel kostet das Benzin nach der Rückvergütung?\" which translates to \"how much does the gasoline cost after the rebate?\" So, maybe they want the total cost, which is $10, or the price per gallon, which would be $1.00?\n\nWait, the original price is $3.00 per gallon. The rebate is $20. So, if you buy 10 gallons, you pay $30, get $20 back, so net payment is $10. So, the total cost is $10. But the question is phrased as \"wie viel kostet das Benzin nach der Rückvergütung?\" which is \"how much does the gasoline cost after the rebate?\" So, maybe they are asking for the price per gallon after the rebate. If that's the case, then $10 total for 10 gallons is $1.00 per gallon. But the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut in the original problem, the price is given as $3.00 per gallon. The rebate is a flat $20. So, the total cost is $30 - $20 = $10. So, the total cost is $10. But if they are asking for the price per gallon after rebate, it's $1.00. However, the question is in German, and the translation might be important. The original question says \"wie viel kostet das Benzin nach der Rückvergütung?\" which is \"how much does the gasoline cost after the rebate?\" So, \"kostet das Benzin\" would be \"costs the gasoline\", so the total cost for the gasoline, not the price per gallon. So, if you buy 10 gallons, the total cost after rebate is $10. Therefore, the answer is $10.\n\nBut let me check again. If the rebate is $20, then regardless of the amount of gasoline, you get $20 back. So, if you buy 10 gallons, you pay $30, get $20 back, so net $10. So, the total cost is $10. Therefore, the answer is $10.00.\n\nAlternatively, if the rebate was per gallon, like $2 per gallon, then 10 gallons would give $20. But the problem states a flat $20. So, the answer is $10.\n</think>\n\nDie Kosten für 10 Gallonen Benzin betragen ursprünglich $3,00 pro Gallone × 10 Gallonen = **$30,00**.

The problem is about Marcell and Beatrice having a competition to eat the most fruit rolls. They unroll all the ones they can find. But someone made a mistake. Beatrice's roll was two rolls wide and 24 rolls long, while Marcell's was three rolls wide and 14 rolls long. The question is, if both eat their entire amount, what's the average number they ate?\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out how many fruit rolls each of them actually had. The problem mentions that their rolls are described in terms of width and length. So, maybe they are talking about the area of the rolls? Like, if a roll is two rolls wide and 24 long, that would be 2 times 24? But wait, the term \"rollen\" here might be a bit confusing. In German, \"Rollen\" can mean rolls, but in this context, maybe they are referring to the number of fruit rolls in a sheet or something?\n\nWait, the original question is in German, but the user provided the translation. Let me check again. The problem says that Beatrice's was two rolls wide and 24 rolls long, and Marcell's was three rolls wide and 14 rolls long. So, if we think of each \"roll\" as a unit, maybe they are talking about the dimensions of a sheet of fruit rolls. For example, if you have a sheet that's 2 units wide and 24 units long, the total number of fruit rolls would be the product of width and length. So, 2 * 24 for Beatrice and 3 * 14 for Marcell.\n\nSo, Beatrice's total would be 2 * 24 = 48 fruit rolls. Marcell's would be 3 * 14 = 42 fruit rolls. Then, the average would be (48 + 42) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45. So, the average is 45.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The key here is understanding what \"breit\" and \"lang\" mean. In German, \"breit\" is width and \"lang\" is length. So, if Beatrice's roll is two rolls wide and 24 rolls long, that would be 2 * 24. Similarly for Marcell. So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that they are talking about the number of rolls they unrolled, not the area? Like, if Beatrice unrolled two rolls in width and 24 in length, but that doesn't quite make sense. Because if you unroll a roll, it's a single roll, but maybe they are talking about multiple rolls arranged in a grid? For example, if you have a grid of fruit rolls, and each roll is a unit, then the total number would be width multiplied by length.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the problem is essentially asking for the area of each grid of fruit rolls, then taking the average of the two areas.\n\nSo, Beatrice: 2 * 24 = 48, Marcell: 3 * 14 = 42. Total is 48 + 42 = 90. Average is 90 / 2 = 45. Therefore, the answer should be 45.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe there's a trick here. The problem says \"die meisten Fruchtrollen essen kann, also entrollen sie alle, die sie finden können.\" So, they unroll all the ones they can find. But the mistake is that Beatrice's was two rolls wide and 24 long, and Marcell's three wide and 14 long. So, maybe the mistake is that they thought the number of rolls is the sum of width and length, but actually it's the product? But the problem says that someone made a mistake, but the question is about the average they ate, assuming they ate their entire amount. So, maybe the mistake is in the way the rolls are counted, but the problem states that they ate their entire amount, so we have to take the given dimensions as the actual number of rolls.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Leider macht jemand einen Fehler und das von Beatrice war zwei Rollen breit und 24 Rollen lang, während das von Marcell 3 Rollen breit und 14 Rollen lang war.\" So, the mistake is that someone made an error, but the dimensions given are the ones that were actually used. So, the question is, if both eat their entire amount, what's the average? So, the answer is based on the given dimensions, which are 2x24 and 3x14. Therefore, the total is 48 + 42 = 90, average 45.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think that's the right approach. So, the answer is 45.\n</think>\n\nMarcell und Beatrice haben jeweils eine Fläche von Fruchtrollen, die durch Breite und Länge beschrieben wird.

Wait, the problem says the shore was sixty-four seconds away. Wait, does that mean the time it takes to reach the shore? Or is that the distance? Wait, the original problem says \"Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt.\" Translating that, it's \"The shore was 64 seconds away.\" That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a translation issue.

But we need to find out how much water was taken in during that time. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Julias Boot hatte ein Leck als sie auf dem See draußen war. Das Boot hat für alle zehn Fuß, die sie zurück zum Ufer gerudert ist, zwei Liter Wasser geschluckt. Sie brauchte sechzehn Sekunden, um zwanzig Fuß zu rudern. Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt. Wie viel Wasser hatte das Boot geschluckt, als Julia den Strand erreichte?\"\n\nSo, translating again:\n\nJulia's boat had a leak when she was out on the lake. The boat took in two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back to shore. She needed sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was sixty-four seconds away. How much water had the boat taken in when Julia reached the shore?\n\nSo, the key points:\n\n- For every 10 feet rowed back to shore, the boat takes in 2 liters of water.\n\n- She took 16 seconds to row 20 feet.\n\n- The shore is 64 seconds away. Wait, that's the time? Or the distance? The original says \"Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt.\" In German, \"entfernt\" can mean \"away\" in terms of distance or time. But given the context, since she took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, maybe the shore is a certain distance, and the time to get there is 64 seconds? But that would be a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the shore is 64 seconds away in terms of time, meaning that it takes her 64 seconds to reach the shore. But then, how does that relate to the distance?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the shore is a certain distance away, and the time it takes to reach it is 64 seconds. But we need to find out how much water was taken in during that time. But to do that, we need to know the rate at which water is entering the boat, which depends on the distance rowed, which in turn depends on her rowing speed.\n\nSo, first, let's figure out her rowing speed. She took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So her speed is 20 feet per 16 seconds. Let's compute that as feet per second. 20 divided by 16 is 1.25 feet per second. So her speed is 1.25 ft/s.\n\nNow, if the shore is 64 seconds away, that probably means that the time it takes her to reach the shore is 64 seconds. Wait, but if she's rowing towards the shore, the time to reach it would depend on the distance. Wait, but maybe the problem is that the shore is 64 seconds away in terms of time, meaning that the total time from when she started rowing to reaching the shore is 64 seconds. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the distance to the shore is such that it would take her 64 seconds to row there. But then, given her speed, we can compute the distance.\n\nWait, let's think again. If she rows at 1.25 feet per second, then in 64 seconds, she would cover 1.25 * 64 = 80 feet. So the distance to the shore is 80 feet. Therefore, the shore is 80 feet away. But the problem says \"Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt.\" So maybe the original problem meant that the time to reach the shore is 64 seconds, which would imply the distance is 80 feet. Then, the question is, how much water was taken in during that 64 seconds of rowing?\n\nBut let's check the original problem again. It says \"Sie brauchte sechzehn Sekunden, um zwanzig Fuß zu rudern.\" So she took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Then, \"Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt.\" So the shore was 64 seconds away. So maybe the time to reach the shore is 64 seconds. Therefore, the total time she spent rowing is 64 seconds. Therefore, we can calculate the total distance she rowed in that time, and then compute the amount of water taken in based on the distance.\n\nBut let's confirm. If she rows at 20 feet per 16 seconds, that's 20/16 = 1.25 feet per second. So in 64 seconds, she would row 1.25 * 64 = 80 feet. Therefore, the distance to the shore is 80 feet. Therefore, she rowed 80 feet to reach the shore.\n\nNow, the boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So for 80 feet, how many 10-foot segments are there? 80 divided by 10 is 8. So 8 segments. Each segment is 2 liters, so 8 * 2 = 16 liters. Therefore, the boat had taken in 16 liters of water when she reached the shore.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"Das Boot hat für alle zehn Fuß, die sie zurück zum Ufer gerudert ist, zwei Liter Wasser geschluckt.\" So for every ten feet she rowed back to shore, the boat took in two liters. So if she rowed 80 feet, then 80 / 10 = 8, so 8 * 2 = 16 liters. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me make sure that the time given (64 seconds) is indeed the total time she spent rowing. The problem says \"Der Strand war 64 Sekunden entfernt.\" If that's the time, then yes. But if it's the distance, then we need to convert that into time. However, given that she took 16 seconds for 20 feet, we can compute the time for any distance. But the problem says the shore was 64 seconds away, which is a bit ambiguous. However, given the context, it's more likely that the time to reach the shore is 64 seconds, so the total rowing time is 64 seconds, leading to 80 feet rowed, hence 16 liters of water.\n\nAlternatively, if the shore was 64 seconds away in terms of distance, but that doesn't make sense because seconds are a unit of time, not distance. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the time to reach the shore is 64 seconds. Therefore, the answer is 16 liters.\n\nBut let me check once more. If the shore was 64 seconds away, meaning that the distance is 64 seconds? That would be a non-sensical unit. So the only logical way is that the time to reach the shore is 64 seconds. Therefore, the answer is 16 liters.\n</think>\n\nJulia's Boot hatte ein Leck, das 2 Liter Wasser für jedes 10 Fuß, die sie zurückruderte, aufnahm.

The problem is about how many times the blackboard is wiped in a day. There are four teachers sharing a blackboard in a classroom. Each teacher has two lessons per day and uses the blackboard in each lesson. The blackboard is wiped three times per lesson. So, I need to figure out the total number of wipes per day.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. Each teacher has two lessons a day. Since there are four teachers, that would be 4 teachers multiplied by 2 lessons each. So 4 * 2 = 8 lessons in total per day. Wait, but does that mean each teacher has two lessons, and each lesson is a separate time when they use the board? So each of those lessons would require wiping the board three times. So for each lesson, regardless of which teacher is teaching, the board is wiped three times. Therefore, the total number of wipes would be the number of lessons multiplied by three.\n\nSo if there are 8 lessons in total, then 8 lessons * 3 wipes per lesson = 24 wipes per day. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, the problem says the teachers share the blackboard and use it alternately. Does that affect the number of lessons? Like, maybe each lesson is one teacher using the board, so four teachers each having two lessons would mean 4*2=8 lessons, each with three wipes. So yes, that still holds. So 8*3=24. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it per teacher. Each teacher uses the board twice a day, each time three wipes. So per teacher, 2*3=6 wipes. Then four teachers would be 4*6=24. Same result. So either way, it's 24. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no trick here. The problem says the teachers share the blackboard and use it alternately, but the number of times they use it is already given as two lessons each. So regardless of how they alternate, the total number of lessons is 8, each with three wipes. So 24 is correct.

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. And Jamal's phone can store 1,800 photos. So maybe I can start by finding out how many photos Brittany's phone can store. If Jamal's is 6 times more, then Brittany's would be Jamal's divided by 6. Let me check that. If Jamal's is 6x Brittany's, then Brittany's is Jamal's divided by 6. So 1,800 divided by 6. Let me calculate that. 1,800 divided by 6 is 300. So Brittany's phone can store 300 photos. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNext part: The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times higher than the number of ducks on Jamal's photo with the ducks at the zoo. Wait, so Brittany's phone capacity (which we found to be 300) is 50 times the number of ducks on Jamal's photo. So if I let the number of ducks be D, then 300 = 50 * D. Therefore, D = 300 / 50. Let me do that division. 300 divided by 50 is 6. So there are 6 ducks on Jamal's photo. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any parts. The problem says \"the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can store is 50 times higher than the number of ducks...\" So yes, Brittany's max photos (300) equals 50 times the number of ducks. So solving for D gives 6. That seems right. \n\nLet me just verify all the steps again. Jamal's phone is 6x Brittany's. Jamal has 1,800, so Brittany has 1,800 / 6 = 300.

Sasha wants to calculate her profit from selling the leftover wood. First, I need to figure out how much she originally paid for all the boards and then how much she can sell them for now, considering the 50% price increase. Then subtract the original cost from the selling price to get the profit.\n\nSo, she has two types of boards: 2x4x10 and 4x4x10. She has ten of the 2x4x10 boards, each costing $10. And five of the 4x4x10 boards, each costing $16. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for each type. For the 2x4x10 boards: 10 pieces times $10 each. That's 10*10 = $100. For the 4x4x10 boards: 5 pieces times $16 each. That's 5*16 = $80. So total original cost is $100 + $80 = $180.\n\nNow, the prices have gone up by 50%. So she can sell them at 1.5 times the original price. Let me check that. If something increases by 50%, the new price is original price plus 50% of it, which is 1.5 times the original. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each 2x4x10 board, she originally paid $10, now she can sell it for 10*1.5 = $15. And each 4x4x10 board was $16, so now it's 16*1.5 = $24.\n\nNow, calculate the total selling price. For the 2x4x10: 10 pieces * $15 = $150. For the 4x4x10: 5 pieces * $24 = $120. Total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.\n\nProfit is total selling price minus original cost. So $270 - $180 = $90. Therefore, Sasha makes a $90 profit.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations. Original cost: 10*10=100, 5*16=80, total 180. Selling price: 10*15=150, 5*24=120, total 270. 270-180=90.

So the total parts would be 7 + 13, which is 20 parts. \n\nWait, the problem says she uses 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Hmm, but the units here are different: teaspoons and cups. But the ratio is given as 7:13, which might be in terms of volume? Or maybe they are considering the number of units, like each part is a teaspoon or a cup? Wait, the question says \"Teelöffel mit Zucker und Tassen mit Wasser im Verhältnis 7:13\". So it's teaspoons of sugar to cups of water in the ratio 7:13. But that seems odd because a teaspoon is a different unit than a cup. Maybe there's a translation issue here? Or maybe they are using the same unit? Wait, the original question is in German, and the user translated it.

Wenn sie insgesamt 120 Teelöffel Zucker und Tassen Wasser verwendet hat, berechne die Anzahl der Teelöffel Zucker, die sie verwendet hat.\"\n\nSo, \"Teelöffel mit Zucker\" (teaspoons with sugar) and \"Tassen mit Wasser\" (cups with water) in the ratio 7:13. Then she uses a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Wait, that's confusing. The total is 120 \"Teelöffel Zucker und Tassen Wasser\", which would be 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. But that doesn't make sense because you can't add teaspoons and cups directly. Maybe it's a translation error, and it should be 120 units, where each unit is either a teaspoon or a cup? Or maybe the ratio is 7:13, and the total number of units (teaspoons and cups) is 120?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the ratio is 7:13, and the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120, but the units are different. But that would require converting cups to teaspoons or vice versa. However, the question asks for the number of teaspoons of sugar, so maybe the ratio is in terms of volume, and they are assuming that 1 cup is equal to a certain number of teaspoons? But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe the problem is in German, and the translation is slightly off. Let me think again.\n\nThe original says: \"Teelöffel mit Zucker und Tassen mit Wasser im Verhältnis 7:13\". So, the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. Then, she uses a total of 120 Teelöffel Zucker und Tassen Wasser. Wait, that would be 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. But that's mixing units. Unless \"Tassen\" is also in teaspoons? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem is that the total number of units (teaspoons and cups) is 120, but the ratio is 7:13. But that would be if each part is a unit, regardless of the type. For example, 7 parts sugar (teaspoons) and 13 parts water (cups), totaling 20 parts. Then, 20 parts = 120 units, so each part is 6 units. Therefore, sugar is 7*6=42 teaspoons. But that would be assuming that the units are the same, which they aren't. But maybe the problem is using \"Teelöffel\" and \"Tassen\" as units, not the actual measurements. Maybe it's a translation error, and it should be \"Teelöffel und Tassen\" (teaspoons and cups) in the ratio 7:13, and the total number of these units is 120. So, 7+13=20 parts, 120 total units, so each part is 6, so sugar is 7*6=42. That seems plausible. But the problem is that the units are different. However, maybe in the context of the problem, they are just using the number of units, regardless of the actual volume. So, even though a teaspoon is a different volume than a cup, the problem is treating them as units in the ratio. So, the answer would be 42 teaspoons of sugar. That seems to be the most straightforward way to interpret it, even though the units are different. Otherwise, if we have to convert cups to teaspoons, we need to know how many teaspoons are in a cup, which is 48 teaspoons in a cup. But that would complicate things, and the problem doesn't mention that. So, I think the intended answer is 42. Let me check again.\n\nIf the ratio is 7:13 (sugar:water), and total units (teaspoons and cups) is 120, then 7+13=20 parts. 120 divided by 20 is 6. So, 7*6=42 teaspoons of sugar. That's the answer. Even though the units are different, the problem might be considering them as separate units in the ratio. So, the answer is 42.\n</think>\n\nKaty verwendet Zucker und Wasser im Verhältnis 7:13.

For each child, 2 pairs at $60 each would be 2 * 60 = $120 per child. Then, three children would be 3 * $120. That's 3 * 120. 3 * 100 is 300, and 3 * 20 is 60, so 300 + 60 = $360. Yep, same result. \n\nSo both methods give me $360. That seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is straightforward: number of children times pairs per child gives total pairs, then multiply by the price per pair. Both approaches confirm the total is $360.\n</think>\n\nJohn kauft 2 Paar Schuhe für jedes seiner 3 Kinder. Das ergibt insgesamt $3 \\times 2 = 6$ Paar Schuhe.

The problem is about calculating the number of containers imported on the second day. So, first, there's a customs officer at the SeaSide customs who counted 2 containers, each with 5 cars. Then the next day, more containers arrived, and the total number of cars at the port increased to 30. We need to find out how many containers were imported on the second day, assuming all containers have 5 cars each.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. On the first day, there were 2 containers, each with 5 cars. So, the number of cars on the first day would be 2 containers multiplied by 5 cars per container. That's 2 * 5 = 10 cars.\n\nThen, the next day, more containers came, and the total number of cars became 30. So, the total cars after the second day is 30. To find out how many cars were added on the second day, we subtract the initial number of cars from the total. That would be 30 total cars minus the 10 cars from the first day. So, 30 - 10 = 20 cars added on the second day.\n\nNow, since each container holds 5 cars, the number of containers on the second day would be the number of cars added divided by the number of cars per container. So, 20 cars divided by 5 cars per container equals 4 containers. Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day.\n\nWait, let me check that again. First day: 2 containers * 5 = 10 cars. Total after second day: 30. So, 30 - 10 = 20 cars on the second day. 20 / 5 = 4 containers. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. The key is to find the difference in the number of cars between the two days and then divide by the number of cars per container. All containers have the same number of cars, so that's straightforward. No need to consider any other factors here. The answer should be 4 containers.\n</think>\n\nDer Zollbeamte zählte am ersten Tag 2 Container mit jeweils 5 Autos, also insgesamt $2 \\times 5 = 10$ Autos.

I need to figure out the total income that Adrian and Lylah earned four years later. The problem says that Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Then, four years later, Adrian's salary increased by 40% compared to what he earned four years ago. Also, both of their salaries increased at the same time. And we know that Adrian earned $40,000 four years ago. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n1. Adrian's original salary (four years ago) was $40,000.\n2. At that time, Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, Lylah's salary four years ago must be less than Adrian's. Let me calculate that first.\n\nIf Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, that means Adrian's salary is Lylah's salary plus 30% of Lylah's salary. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\nAdrian's salary = Lylah's salary * (1 + 30/100) = Lylah's salary * 1.3\n\nWe know Adrian's salary four years ago was $40,000, so:\n\n40,000 = Lylah's salary * 1.3\n\nTherefore, Lylah's salary four years ago would be 40,000 divided by 1.3. Let me compute that.\n\n40,000 / 1.3. Let me do the division. 1.3 times 30,000 is 39,000. So 40,000 - 39,000 is 1,000. So that's 30,000 + (1,000 / 1.3). Let me calculate 1,000 / 1.3. That's approximately 769.23. So total Lylah's salary four years ago is approximately $30,769.23. Let me check that again. 1.3 * 30,769.23 ≈ 40,000. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.\n\nNow, the problem says that four years later, Adrian's salary increased by 40% compared to what he earned four years ago. So, Adrian's new salary is 40% more than his original salary. Let me calculate that.\n\nOriginal salary: $40,000. 40% of that is 0.4 * 40,000 = $16,000. So his new salary is 40,000 + 16,000 = $56,000. So Adrian's salary four years later is $56,000.\n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions that both Adrian and Lylah's salaries increased at the same time. So, does that mean that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage? Or is there another way? Wait, the problem says \"Adriens und Lylahs Gehalt gleichzeitig steigen\" which translates to \"Adrian's and Lylah's salaries increased at the same time.\" But it doesn't specify by what percentage. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Vier Jahre später erhöhte sich sein Gehalt und er verdiente 40 % mehr als das, was er vor vier Jahren verdient hat. Wenn Adriens und Lylahs Gehalt gleichzeitig steigen und Adrian vor vier Jahren 40.000 US-Dollar verdient hat...\"\n\nSo, the key part is: \"Vier Jahre später erhöhte sich sein Gehalt und er verdiente 40 % mehr als das, was er vor vier Jahren verdient hat.\" So, Adrian's salary increased by 40% compared to four years ago. Then, \"Wenn Adriens und Lylahs Gehalt gleichzeitig steigen...\" So, both of their salaries increased at the same time. But does that mean that Lylah's salary also increased by 40%? Or is there another factor?\n\nWait, the problem might be implying that both of their salaries increased by the same percentage. But the problem only specifies that Adrian's salary increased by 40% compared to his original salary. However, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again.\n\nThe original statement says: \"Vier Jahre später erhöhte sich sein Gehalt und er verdiente 40 % mehr als das, was er vor vier Jahren verdient hat.\" So, Adrian's salary increased by 40% compared to his salary four years ago. Then, \"Wenn Adriens und Lylahs Gehalt gleichzeitig steigen...\" So, both of their salaries increased at the same time. But the problem doesn't specify by what percentage Lylah's salary increased. Wait, but maybe the increase is the same as Adrian's? Or is there another way?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that both of their salaries increased by the same percentage. But the problem only gives information about Adrian's increase. However, the problem says \"Adriens und Lylahs Gehalt gleichzeitig steigen\" which might mean that both of their salaries increased, but not necessarily by the same percentage. However, since the problem doesn't specify how much Lylah's salary increased, maybe we need to assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same 40%? But that might not be correct.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again.

Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week for his drawings. The question is asking how many sheets he uses in a month. Hmm, first I need to figure out how many weeks there are in a month. Wait, but months can vary in length, right? Some have 30 days, some 31, and February has 28 or 29. But maybe the problem expects a standard assumption, like 4 weeks per month? Or maybe they want to use an average?\n\nWait, the problem mentions a \"Zeichenblock\" which has 30 sheets. But the question is about how many sheets he uses per month, not how many blocks. So maybe the block information is a red herring? Or maybe it's relevant for another part of the question? Wait, the original question is only asking about the number of sheets per month, so maybe the block is just extra info. Let me check again.\n\nThe question is: \"Miguel verwendet 2 Blätter Papier pro Woche für seine Zeichnungen. Wenn ein Zeichenblock 30 Blätter Papier hat, wie viele Blätter Papier verbraucht er dann pro Monat?\"\n\nSo, the first part is 2 sheets per week. The second part says a block has 30 sheets. But the question is about how many sheets he uses per month. So maybe the block is just context, but not needed for the calculation? Unless there's a trick here. Maybe they want to know how many blocks he uses per month, but the question specifically asks for sheets. So probably the block info is irrelevant here.\n\nSo, assuming that, then the answer would be 2 sheets/week multiplied by the number of weeks in a month. Now, the problem is that months have different numbers of weeks. But in many cases, people approximate a month as 4 weeks. However, if we take an average, a month is about 4.33 weeks (since 52 weeks in a year divided by 12 months is roughly 4.33). But maybe the question expects a simple 4 weeks per month.\n\nBut let's think. If we use 4 weeks, then 2 sheets/week * 4 weeks = 8 sheets per month. But if we use 4.33 weeks, then 2 * 4.33 ≈ 8.66 sheets. However, since the problem is in German, maybe they use a different standard. In some educational contexts, they might use 4 weeks per month for simplicity. But I should check if there's a standard way to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to use the number of weeks in a month as 4.33, but since the answer is likely to be an integer, maybe 8 or 9? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the number of weeks in a month. That's a bit ambiguous. However, in many math problems, unless specified otherwise, they might assume 4 weeks per month. So 2 * 4 = 8.\n\nBut wait, another approach: if we consider a month as 30 days, and a week as 7 days, then 30 / 7 ≈ 4.2857 weeks. So 2 * 4.2857 ≈ 8.57 sheets. But again, the answer might need to be a whole number. However, the problem might not require rounding. Wait, but the original question is in German, and maybe in the German education system, they use a specific number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a textbook where they use 4 weeks per month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the number of weeks in a month as 4.33, but since the answer is in whole sheets, they might round it. However, without specific instructions, it's hard to tell. But given that the problem gives a block with 30 sheets, maybe that's a hint. Wait, if he uses 2 sheets per week, then in a month (approx 4.33 weeks), he uses about 8.66 sheets. If the block has 30 sheets, maybe the question is leading towards how many blocks he needs, but the question is about sheets, not blocks. So maybe the block info is irrelevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where a month is considered as 4 weeks, so 2*4=8. But I need to check if there's a standard. In some countries, they might use 4 weeks per month for simplicity in math problems. For example, in the US, sometimes they use 4 weeks per month for estimation. So maybe that's the case here.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be 8 sheets per month. However, if the problem expects a more accurate calculation, it would be approximately 8.57, but since you can't have a fraction of a sheet, maybe 9? But the problem doesn't specify rounding. Hmm.\n\nWait, the original question is in German. Let me check if there's a standard in German education. In Germany, when teaching math, they might use 4 weeks per month for simplicity, or they might use the exact number. But without specific information, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem provides a block with 30 sheets, which is a round number, maybe they expect a round answer. If we take 4 weeks, 8 sheets. If we take 4.33 weeks, 8.66, which is close to 9. But maybe the answer is 8.66, but since the question is about sheets, which are whole numbers, they might expect rounding to the nearest whole number, which would be 9. However, without explicit instructions, it's ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a textbook where they use 4 weeks per month. For example, if the question is in a chapter that assumes 4 weeks per month, then 8 is the answer. But since I don't have that context, I need to make an assumption.\n\nIn many basic math problems, especially in elementary education, they often use 4 weeks per month for simplicity. So I think the expected answer here is 8 sheets per month. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n</think>\n\nMiguel verwendet 2 Blätter Papier pro Woche.

Morisette had 5 apples, so double that would be 5 times 2, which is 10 apples. Got that part.\n\nThen, for the oranges, Kael brought half as many as Morisette.

But that would be 6 + 6 = 12 hours, so 12 + 1 = 13 hours for the rest of the week? But that doesn't make sense because the rest of the week is multiple days. The wording says \"1 Stunde mehr als an diesen beiden Tagen geschlafen hat\" – \"slept 1 hour more than on those two days.\" So, per day? Or total?\n\nHmm, the German might be a bit ambiguous. Let me think. If it's \"1 Stunde mehr als an diesen beiden Tagen\" – \"1 hour more than on those two days\" – but if it's per day, then each day of the rest of the week she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours. If it's total, then the rest of the week she slept 12 + 1 = 13 hours. But that would be 13 hours over 4 days, which is 3.25 hours per day, which seems odd. So more likely, it's per day. So 7 hours per day for Thursday to Sunday.\n\nTherefore, total hours would be 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours. So the answer is 48 hours.\n</think>\n\nSadie hat am Montag **8 Stunden** geschlafen.

Rosie can run for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, and then she runs at 5 miles per hour. The question is asking how many miles she can cover in 7 hours total. Hmm, so I need to figure out the distance she covers in each part of her run and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. The first part is 3 hours at 10 mph. To find the distance, I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So for the first part, that would be 10 mph * 3 hours. Let me calculate that: 10 * 3 = 30 miles. Okay, so she covers 30 miles in the first 3 hours.\n\nNow, after those 3 hours, she continues running but at a slower speed of 5 mph. The total time she has is 7 hours, so the remaining time after the first 3 hours is 7 - 3 = 4 hours. So she runs for 4 more hours at 5 mph. Again, using the distance formula: 5 mph * 4 hours. That would be 5 * 4 = 20 miles.\n\nSo adding both parts together: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst part: 3 hours * 10 mph = 30 miles. Second part: 4 hours * 5 mph = 20 miles. Total distance: 30 + 20 = 50 miles. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem states she runs 3 hours at 10 mph and then 5 mph for the remaining time. The total time is 7 hours, so the second part is indeed 4 hours. Multiplying each segment's speed by time and adding gives the total distance. I think that's all there is to it.

So the problem is about Jennie helping in her mom's office. She has a stack of 60 letters that need to be franked (which I think means stamped, right?), and another stack that's already franked. She puts stamps on a third of the letters that need to be franked. Now, the already franked stack has 30 letters. The question is, how many letters were in the franked stack when Jennie started?\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, there are two stacks: one with 60 letters that need to be franked, and another that's already franked. She stamps a third of the 60 letters. So, a third of 60 is 20. So she stamps 20 letters. Then, those 20 letters would move from the \"needs franking\" stack to the \"already franked\" stack, right? Because once you stamp them, they're done.\n\nBut the problem says that now, the already franked stack has 30 letters. So, if she added 20 letters to it, then before she started, the already franked stack must have had 30 minus 20 letters. Wait, that would be 10. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the initial number of letters in the already franked stack. Let's denote the initial number as x. Then, after Jennie stamps 20 letters, the already franked stack becomes x + 20. According to the problem, this is equal to 30. So x + 20 = 30, which means x = 10. So the answer would be 10?\n\nBut wait, the question says \"wie viele Briefe waren in dem Stapel, als Jennie angefangen hat?\" which translates to \"how many letters were in the stack when Jennie started?\" So the already franked stack had x letters initially, and after she added 20, it became 30. So x = 10. That seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem mentions she has a stack of 60 letters that need to be franked and a stack that's already franked. She stamps a third of the 60, which is 20. So those 20 are moved to the already franked stack. The already franked stack now has 30 letters. Therefore, before she started, it had 30 - 20 = 10 letters. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another interpretation? Maybe the already franked stack was 30 letters, and she added 20 to it, making it 50? But the problem says \"now\" the already franked stack has 30 letters. So the 30 is after she added the 20. Therefore, the initial number was 10.

So, the problem is in German, but I'll translate it as I go.\n\nJulia was preparing for a dinner party where she wanted to serve stew. She noticed she didn't have any plastic spoons left, so she bought a new package of spoons. Later, her husband bought a package with 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. While preparing the stew, Julia used three of the spoons to taste the soup. Later, when setting the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. The question is: How many spoons were in the package Julia bought?\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, Julia had no plastic spoons left, so she bought a package. Let's call the number of spoons in Julia's package \"x\". Then her husband bought a package with 5 spoons and gave them to her. So, after her husband gave her the 5 spoons, she had x + 5 spoons in total.\n\nBut then, Julia used three spoons to taste the soup. So, she used three spoons, which would mean the total number of spoons she had after that would be (x + 5) - 3. However, the problem says that when she set the table, she had 12 spoons. So, the equation would be:\n\n(x + 5) - 3 = 12\n\nSimplifying that:\n\nx + 2 = 12\n\nTherefore, x = 10.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed something. Let's go through the timeline again.\n\n1. Julia had no spoons left. So, she bought a package of x spoons. Now she has x spoons.\n\n2. Her husband bought a package with 5 spoons and gave them to her. So now she has x + 5 spoons.\n\n3. She used three spoons for tasting. So, she used three, which would reduce her total by three. So, x + 5 - 3 = x + 2.\n\n4. Then, when setting the table, she had 12 spoons. So, x + 2 = 12. Therefore, x = 10.\n\nThat seems straightforward. But let me make sure there's no other interpretation. For example, maybe the husband's package was in addition to Julia's original spoons, but the problem says she had no plastic spoons left, so she bought a new package. Then her husband gave her another package. So, the total after buying both packages would be x + 5, then she used three, so x + 5 - 3 = 12. So, x = 10. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a misunderstanding about when the husband gave her the spoons? The problem says \"später kaufte auch ihr Mann eine Packung mit 5 neuen Löffeln und gab sie Julia.\" So, \"later\" her husband bought a package and gave it to her. So, after Julia had bought her package, her husband added another 5. Then she used three, and then had 12. So, yes, the calculation is correct.\n\nAnother possible confusion: Did Julia have any spoons before buying the package? The problem says she had no plastic spoons left, so she bought a new package. So, before buying, she had zero. Then she bought x, then husband added 5, then she used 3, ending up with 12. So, x + 5 - 3 = 12 → x = 10. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. 10 spoons in the package Julia bought.\n</think>\n\nJulia kaufte eine Packung Löffel mit $ x $ Löffeln. Ihr Mann gab ihr später 5 zusätzliche Löffel.

Then, the fish sausages are 6 more than the chicken ones. So, if chicken is 38, then fish should be 38 plus 6. Let me write that down:\n\nChicken sausages = 38\nFish sausages = 38 + 6 = 44\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So then the total sausages would be the sum of chicken and fish. So 38 plus 44.

I need to figure out how much Dillon spends in total on 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The problem says that each watermelon costs three times more than each pepper. Each orange costs five times less than a watermelon. And each pepper is $15. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note the price of each pepper. It's given as $15. So, one pepper is $15. Now, the watermelon is three times more expensive than a pepper. So, if a pepper is $15, then a watermelon would be 3 times that. Let me calculate that: 15 multiplied by 3. 15*3 is 45. So, each watermelon is $45. Got that.\n\nNext, the oranges. The problem says an orange costs five times less than a watermelon. Wait, \"five times less\" can be a bit confusing. Does that mean the orange is 1/5 the price of a watermelon? Because if something is five times less, it's like dividing by five. So, if the watermelon is $45, then an orange would be 45 divided by 5. Let me check that. 45 divided by 5 is 9. So, each orange is $9. That seems right. Alternatively, if someone interprets \"five times less\" as subtracting five times, but that would be nonsensical here because you can't subtract 5 times the price from the watermelon price. So, the correct interpretation is dividing by five. So, $9 per orange.\n\nNow, Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Let me calculate each part separately and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the watermelons: 4 watermelons at $45 each. So, 4*45. Let me compute that. 4*40 is 160, and 4*5 is 20, so total is 160+20=180. So, $180 for the watermelons.\n\nNext, the peppers: 20 peppers at $15 each. 20*15. Well, 10*15 is 150, so 20*15 is 300. So, $300 for the peppers.\n\nThen, the oranges: 10 oranges at $9 each. 10*9 is 90. So, $90 for the oranges.\n\nNow, adding all those amounts together: $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $90 (oranges). Let's add them step by step. 180 + 300 is 480. Then, 480 + 90 is 570. So, the total amount Dillon spends is $570.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nWatermelon price: 3*15=45. Correct. Oranges: 45/5=9.

I need to figure out the profit the hospital makes from these consultations. Hmm, the problem says 500 people are examined each day, and each patient takes an average of 24 minutes. The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, and the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. So, profit would be the revenue from the patients minus the cost to the hospital from the doctors, right?\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total time spent on all patients. Since each patient takes 24 minutes, and there are 500 patients a day, that's 500 multiplied by 24 minutes. Let me do that: 500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes. Now, I need to convert that into hours because the rates are per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 12,000 divided by 60. Let me calculate that: 12,000 / 60 = 200 hours. So, the total time spent is 200 hours per day.\n\nNext, the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. Wait, does that mean per hour of consultation? So, if the total time is 200 hours, then the revenue from patients would be 200 hours * $200/hour. That would be 200 * 200 = $40,000 per day.\n\nOn the cost side, the doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. So, the cost to the hospital is 200 hours * $150/hour. That's 200 * 150 = $30,000 per day.\n\nTherefore, the profit would be revenue minus cost: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000 per day. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I interpreted the rates correctly.\n\nThe problem says the doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. So, that's the cost the hospital incurs for the doctors' time. The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour for the consultation. So, yes, the revenue is based on the time spent with patients, and the cost is based on the same time. So, the calculation seems right.\n\nBut wait, another thought: is the $150 per hour the rate per doctor or per hour of work? The problem says \"die Ärzte berechnen dem Krankenhaus 150 $ pro Stunde,\" which translates to \"the doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.\" So, that's probably the cost the hospital has to pay the doctors for their time. So, if the total time is 200 hours, then the hospital pays 200 * 150 = $30,000 to the doctors. Then, the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour for the same 200 hours, so 200 * 200 = $40,000. Profit is 40k - 30k = 10k. That seems correct.\n\nI don't see any other costs mentioned, so I think that's all. Maybe I should check if there's a different interpretation. For example, maybe the $150 is per patient or something else, but the problem says \"pro Stunde,\" so per hour. So, the calculation should be correct. Therefore, the profit is $10,000 per day.\n</think>\n\nDas Krankenhaus macht einen Gewinn von **10.000 $ pro Tag**. \n\n**Berechnung:**\n1. **Gesamte Untersuchungszeit:**  \n   $ 500 \\, \\text{Patienten} \\times 24 \\, \\text{Minuten} = 12.000 \\, \\text{Minuten} = 200 \\, \\text{Stunden} $.\n\n2. **Einnahmen aus Patienten:**  \n   $ 200 \\, \\text{Stunden} \\times 200 \\, \\text{\\$} = 40.000 \\, \\text{\\$} $.\n\n3. **Kosten für Ärzte:**  \n   $ 200 \\, \\text{Stunden} \\times 150 \\, \\text{\\$} = 30.000 \\, \\text{\\$} $.\n\n4. **Gewinn:**  \n   $ 40.000 \\, \\text{\\$} - 30.000 \\, \\text{\\$} = 10.000 \\, \\text{\\$} $.\n\n**Antwort:** Das Krankenhaus macht einen Gewinn von **10.000 $ pro Tag**."]], "filtered_resps": ["10.000"], "doc_hash": "335f3273ef26d45150c79fa52832fdb94f92704da54808acf7b142d98e0e2c9d", "prompt_hash": "4fd1464b9daf228f70c836f15a832ae0b450946e2873ad7ea075b1a446c54809", "target_hash": "39e5b4830d4d9c14db7368a95b65d5463ea3d09520373723430c03a5a453b5df", "exact_match": 1.0}

The problem is about Pam and Fred going to a carnival. They rode the roller coaster and then the sled. Each ride costs 6 tickets. I need to figure out how many tickets they used in total that day.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and Fred rode it 4 times. Then, both of them decided to ride the sled 2 times each. Each ride, whether it's the roller coaster or the sled, costs 6 tickets. So, I need to calculate the total number of rides they took and multiply that by 6 to get the total tickets used.\n\nWait, but the question says \"jede Fahrt 6 Karten kostet,\" which translates to each ride costs 6 tickets. So, regardless of which ride they took, each individual ride is 6 tickets. So, I need to count all the rides they did and multiply by 6.\n\nLet me start with the roller coaster. Pam did 2 rides, Fred did 4. So together, that's 2 + 4 = 6 roller coaster rides. Then, the sled: each of them did 2 rides. So Pam did 2 sled rides, Fred also 2. That's 2 + 2 = 4 sled rides. So total rides are 6 (roller coaster) + 4 (sled) = 10 rides. Each ride is 6 tickets, so 10 * 6 = 60 tickets. Is that right?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check again. Let me do it step by step.\n\nFirst, Pam's rides: 2 roller coaster rides and 2 sled rides. So that's 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred's rides: 4 roller coaster and 2 sled. That's 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

So the problem is about Walt walking different distances on different days. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, it says that on Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. Got that. Then on Thursday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, if Monday was 4 miles, then Thursday would be 6 multiplied by 4. Let me calculate that: 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Thursday. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the next part says that from Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles. Wait, so that's Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday combined? The question is asking how many miles he walked on Wednesday. So, we need to figure out Tuesday and Wednesday's distances, but we only have information about Monday and Thursday. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem states: \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen.\" That translates to \"From Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles.\" So that's Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. We know Monday is 4 miles. So if we can find out Tuesday and Wednesday, but we don't have direct info on Tuesday. However, maybe there's something else?\n\nWait, the problem only gives us info about Monday and Thursday. Thursday is separate. So maybe the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, which includes Monday (4 miles), Tuesday (unknown), and Wednesday (unknown). But we don't have any other numbers. Wait, is there any other information? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: On Monday, 4 miles. On Thursday, 6 times Monday's distance, which is 24 miles. From Monday to Wednesday, total 41 miles. So, the question is how many miles on Wednesday. But we don't have any info about Tuesday or Wednesday. Wait, is there something missing here? Or maybe I need to assume that the only other day is Tuesday? But how?\n\nWait, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nOriginal question: \"Am Montag ging Walt 4 Meilen zu Fuß. Am Donnerstag ging er 6 Mal so viele Meilen, wie er am Montag gegangen war. Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen. Wie viele Meilen ist er am Mittwoch gegangen?\"\n\nSo, Monday: 4 miles. Thursday: 6 * Monday = 24 miles. From Monday to Wednesday (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) total 41 miles. So, the total of Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday = 41. We know Monday is 4, so Tuesday + Wednesday = 41 - 4 = 37 miles. But we don't have any other info. Wait, but the problem is only asking for Wednesday. How can we find that?\n\nWait, maybe there's a missing piece here. The problem mentions Thursday, but the total from Monday to Wednesday is given. Unless there's an assumption that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Thursday? But that's not stated. Or maybe the problem is in German and there's a translation issue? Let me check the original again.\n\nOriginal German: \"Am Montag ging Walt 4 Meilen zu Fuß. Am Donnerstag ging er 6 Mal so viele Meilen, wie er am Montag gegangen war. Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen. Wie viele Meilen ist er am Mittwoch gegangen?\"\n\nNo, the translation seems correct. So, the problem gives us Monday and Thursday's distances, and the total from Monday to Wednesday. But without any info on Tuesday or Wednesday, how can we find Wednesday's distance? There must be something missing here. Wait, maybe the problem is that \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is sometimes interpreted as \"from Monday to Wednesday inclusive,\" which is three days, but maybe in some contexts it could be interpreted as \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Tuesday and Wednesday? But that would be unusual. Typically, \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" would include all days from Monday to Wednesday, i.e., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\nBut if that's the case, then we have Monday (4) + Tuesday (x) + Wednesday (y) = 41. But we have two variables here, x and y. So unless there's another equation, we can't solve for y. But the problem is asking for y, so there must be something else. Wait, maybe the problem is in the translation? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original says \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen.\" So \"from Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles.\" So that's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But we only know Monday's distance. So unless there's an assumption that he walked the same distance on Tuesday and Wednesday? But that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is missing some information, or there's a typo?\n\nWait, maybe the problem meant to say that from Monday to Thursday, the total was 41 miles? But that would include Thursday, which is 24 miles. Let's check: If Monday is 4, Thursday is 24, then Monday to Thursday would be 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday + 24 = 41. Then Tuesday + Wednesday = 41 - 4 -24 = 13. But that's just speculation. However, the original says \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch,\" which is Monday to Wednesday, not including Thursday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation of \"Gesamtstrecke\" which is \"total distance.\" So, maybe the total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and we need to find Wednesday's distance. But without knowing Tuesday's distance, we can't. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or perhaps a missing piece of information.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is in the original German, and there's a different interpretation. Let me think again. The problem says: On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Thursday, he walked 6 times as many as on Monday. From Monday to Wednesday, his total distance was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?\n\nWait, unless \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is meant to be \"from Monday to Wednesday\" as in the period starting on Monday and ending on Wednesday, which would be three days. But if we don't have info on Tuesday, how can we find Wednesday? Maybe the problem assumes that he walked the same distance on Tuesday and Wednesday? But that's an assumption not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check the numbers again. If Monday is 4, Thursday is 24. The total from Monday to Wednesday is 41. So, 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday = 41. Therefore, Tuesday + Wednesday = 37. But without more info, we can't find Wednesday. So, unless there's a typo and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41, then we could do 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday + 24 = 41, so Tuesday + Wednesday = 13. Still two variables.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Tuesday and Wednesday? That would be unusual, but if that's the case, then the total of Tuesday and Wednesday is 41. But then we still don't know how much he walked on Tuesday or Wednesday. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is missing a part where it says something about Tuesday's distance? For example, if it said he walked twice as much on Tuesday as on Monday, or something like that. But as it stands, the problem as given doesn't provide enough information to determine Wednesday's distance. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or perhaps a misinterpretation.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem says he walked 4 miles on Monday, 6 times that on Thursday (24 miles). The total from Monday to Wednesday is 41. So, if we consider that maybe the total from Monday to Wednesday includes Thursday? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the problem is in the translation of \"bis\" which can sometimes mean \"up to\" but not necessarily including. But in German, \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" would typically include all days from Monday to Wednesday, i.e., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\nWait, unless the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" as in the period starting on Monday and ending on Wednesday, which is three days. But again, without knowing Tuesday's distance, we can't find Wednesday's.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting us to assume that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday? If that's the case, then Tuesday would be 4 miles, and Wednesday would be 41 - 4 - 4 = 33 miles. But that's an assumption not stated in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and since Thursday is 24, but that's separate. But that still doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41. Let's try that. If that's the case, then Monday (4) + Tuesday (x) + Wednesday (y) + Thursday (24) = 41. So, x + y = 41 - 4 -24 = 13. Still two variables. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Tuesday and Wednesday, so the total of Tuesday and Wednesday is 41. Then, if we assume that Tuesday is the same as Monday, which is 4, then Wednesday would be 41 - 4 = 37. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is missing a part where it says something about the distance on Tuesday. For example, if it said he walked 3 times as much on Tuesday as on Monday, then we could calculate. But as it stands, the problem as given doesn't have enough information. Therefore, I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps a translation error.\n\nBut since the user is asking for an answer, maybe I need to check again. Let me re-express the problem in equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nMonday: M = 4 miles\n\nThursday: Th = 6 * M = 6 * 4 = 24 miles\n\nTotal from Monday to Wednesday: M + T + W = 41 miles, where T is Tuesday, W is Wednesday.\n\nWe need to find W.\n\nBut we have:\n\n4 + T + W = 41 => T + W = 37.\n\nBut with only this equation, we can't find W unless we have another equation. Therefore, the problem is underdetermined. There's not enough information to solve for W.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem assumes that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Thursday? That would be a stretch, but let's try. If T = Th = 24, then W = 37 - 24 = 13. But that's assuming Tuesday is the same as Thursday, which is not stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday, so T = 4, then W = 37 - 4 = 33. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41. Then:\n\nM + T + W + Th = 41 => 4 + T + W + 24 = 41 => T + W = 13. Still two variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total from Tuesday to Thursday is 41? Then T + W + Th = 41 => T + W + 24 = 41 => T + W = 17. Still two variables.\n\nWait, unless the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Wednesday, which would be strange. If that's the case, then W = 41, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the total from Monday to Wednesday, which is 41, and the answer is 41, but that's not the question. The question is asking for how many miles he walked on Wednesday.\n\nGiven that, I think there must be an error in the problem statement. However, since the user is expecting an answer, maybe I need to consider that perhaps the problem meant to say that from Monday to Thursday, the total is 41, and then we can calculate. Let's try that.\n\nIf total from Monday to Thursday is 41:\n\nM + T + W + Th = 41\n\n4 + T + W + 24 = 41\n\nT + W = 41 - 4 -24 = 13\n\nBut still two variables. Unless there's another piece of info.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch betrug seine Gesamtstrecke 41 Meilen.\" So that's Monday to Wednesday. If we assume that the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and we know Monday is 4, then Tuesday + Wednesday = 37. But without more info, we can't find Wednesday.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Wednesday, which would be strange. If that's the case, then Wednesday is 41, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is missing a part where it says something about the distance on Tuesday. For example, if it said he walked twice as much on Tuesday as on Monday, then T = 8, and W = 37 - 8 = 29. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nGiven that, I think there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, since the user is expecting an answer, maybe I need to check if there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is meant to be \"from Monday to Wednesday\" as in the period starting on Monday and ending on Wednesday, which is three days, but the problem is in German, and sometimes \"bis\" can be exclusive. For example, \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" might mean from Monday up to but not including Wednesday, which would be Monday and Tuesday. If that's the case, then the total of Monday and Tuesday is 41. Then, since Monday is 4, Tuesday would be 41 - 4 = 37, and then Wednesday is unknown. But the question is about Wednesday, so that still doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, if \"bis\" is exclusive, then \"von Montag bis Mittwoch\" would be Monday and Tuesday, totaling 41. Then, Tuesday is 37, and Wednesday is unknown. Still no help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation of \"Gesamtstrecke\" as \"total distance,\" but maybe it's supposed to be \"total distance on Wednesday\" or something else. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven that, I think the problem as stated is missing information. However, since the user is expecting an answer, perhaps there's a standard assumption I'm missing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning the total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and the question is asking for Wednesday's distance. If we assume that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday, which is 4, then Wednesday would be 41 - 4 - 4 = 33. But that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Thursday, which is 24, then Wednesday would be 41 - 4 -24 = 13. But again, that's an assumption.\n\nSince the problem is presented in German, maybe there's a cultural context or a common problem structure that I'm not aware of. For example, sometimes in math problems, if only one day's distance is given and the total is given for a range of days, it's assumed that the other days have the same distance. But that's not a universal rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the answer is 41 - 4 = 37, assuming that \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is only Tuesday and Wednesday, but that's not standard.\n\nGiven that, I think the most plausible answer, even though it's based on an assumption, is that the problem expects us to assume that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday, leading to Wednesday being 33 miles. However, this is purely speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41, and then we can calculate. Let's try that:\n\nIf total from Monday to Thursday is 41:\n\nMonday: 4\n\nThursday: 24\n\nSo, 4 + Tuesday + Wednesday + 24 = 41 => Tuesday + Wednesday = 13. Still two variables.\n\nBut if we assume that Tuesday is the same as Monday, then Tuesday = 4, so Wednesday = 13 - 4 = 9. But again, this is an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem meant that the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41, and the total from Monday to Thursday is 41 + 24 = 65, but that's not helpful.\n\nI think I need to conclude that the problem as stated is missing information. However, since the user is expecting an answer, and given that in some problems, if only one day is given and the total is for a range, sometimes it's assumed that the other days are zero, but that would be odd.\n\nWait, if we assume that he didn't walk on Tuesday, then Wednesday would be 41 - 4 = 37. But that's also an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the original German, and \"Von Montag bis Mittwoch\" is actually \"from Monday to Wednesday\" meaning only Wednesday, which would be 41, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that, I think the most reasonable answer, even though it's based on an assumption, is that the problem expects us to assume that the distance on Tuesday is the same as on Monday, leading to Wednesday being 33 miles. So, I'll go with that, but with the caveat that the problem is missing information.\n</think>\n\nUm die Meilen, die Walt am Mittwoch gegangen ist, zu berechnen, gehen wir wie folgt vor:\n\n1. **Montag:** Walt ging **4 Meilen**.\n2. **Donnerstag:** Er ging **6 Mal so viele Meilen wie am Montag**, also $6 \\times 4 = 24$ Meilen.\n3. **Gesamtstrecke von Montag bis Mittwoch:** 41 Meilen.

The problem is about Brian and his friend Bobby's video games. So, first, I need to figure out how many video games Bobby has based on the information given. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Bobby has 5 fewer video games than three times as many as Brian. Hmm, okay. So, if Brian has a certain number of games, Bobby's number is calculated by taking three times Brian's amount and subtracting 5. But wait, there's a catch here. Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5 before the comparison was made. So, I need to adjust Brian's current number of games before calculating Bobby's.\n\nLet me confirm: Brian started with 20, but lost 5, so now he has 20 - 5 = 15 games. Right? That seems straightforward. So Brian currently has 15 video games.\n\nNow, Bobby has 5 fewer than three times Brian's current amount. So, three times Brian's games would be 3 * 15. Let me calculate that: 3 * 15 is 45. Then subtract 5, so 45 - 5 = 40. Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.\n\nWait, let me check if I interpreted the original statement correctly. The problem says \"Brians Freund Bobby hat 5 Videospiele weniger als 3 Mal so viele wie Brian.\" Translating that from German: \"Bobby has 5 video games less than three times as many as Brian.\" So yes, that's exactly what I did. Three times Brian's amount minus 5. So if Brian has 15, three times that is 45, minus 5 is 40. That seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The key points are: Brian originally had 20, lost 5, so now has 15. Bobby's amount is based on Brian's current amount. The problem says \"kurz bevor der Vergleich angestellt wurde,\" which means \"shortly before the comparison was made.\" So the comparison is made after Brian lost the 5 games. Therefore, the 20 is the original number, but the current number is 15. So yes, using 15 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: If the problem had said that Brian had 20 games when the comparison was made, then Bobby would have 3*20 -5 = 55. But since Brian lost 5 before the comparison, his current number is 15, so Bobby has 3*15 -5 = 40. That makes sense.\n\nI don't see any other factors here. The problem is straightforward once you adjust Brian's number correctly.

Rory is ordering some food and wants to know the total cost of her delivery order. Let me break this down step by step. First, she's buying 2 Jumbo Sandwiches at $7.50 each. So, I need to calculate the cost for those. Then, she's getting 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. After adding up all those items, there's a 20% delivery fee, and she wants to add $5.00 as a tip. I need to figure out the total cost including all these.\n\nAlright, starting with the sandwiches. Each is $7.50, and she's getting 2. So, 7.50 multiplied by 2. Let me do that: 7.50 * 2 = 15.00. So that's $15.00 for the sandwiches.\n\nNext, the chips. Each bag is $1.50, and she's buying 2. So, 1.50 * 2. Hmm, 1.50 times 2 is 3.00. So that's $3.00 for the chips.\n\nThen the cookies. Each cookie is $1.00, and she's getting 2. So, 1.00 * 2 = 2.00. That's $2.00 for the cookies.\n\nNow, adding up all the items: sandwiches, chips, and cookies. So, 15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00. Let me add those together. 15 + 3 is 18, and 18 + 2 is 20. So the total cost before delivery fee and tip is $20.00.\n\nNow, the delivery fee is 20% of the total. So, I need to calculate 20% of $20.00. To find 20%, I can multiply 20.00 by 0.20. Let's see, 20 * 0.20 = 4.00. So the delivery fee is $4.00.\n\nThen, she wants to add $5.00 as a tip. So, adding that to the previous total. The total before tip was $20.00 plus $4.00 delivery fee, which is $24.00. Then adding the $5.00 tip: 24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, is the delivery fee calculated on the total of the items, and then the tip is added on top of that? So the original items are $20.00. Then 20% of that is $4.00, making the subtotal $24.00. Then the tip is $5.00, so total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00. That seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"An der Kasse werden 20 % Liefergebühr addiert, und sie will 5,00 $ Trinkgeld addieren.\" So, in German, that translates to \"At the checkout, 20% delivery fee is added, and she wants to add $5.00 tip.\" So yes, the delivery fee is added to the total of the items, and then the tip is added on top of that. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the total cost is $29.00. Let me just verify each step once more.\n\nSandwiches: 2 * 7.50 = 15.00. Correct.\n\nChips: 2 * 1.50 = 3.00. Correct.\n\nCookies: 2 * 1.00 = 2.00. Correct.\n\nTotal items: 15 + 3 + 2 = 20. Correct.\n\nDelivery fee: 20% of 20 = 4.00. Correct.\n\nSubtotal after delivery: 20 + 4 = 24.00.\n\nTip: 5.00. Total: 24 + 5 = 29.00. Yes, that's right.\n\nI think that's all.

Then today, he took another test with 100 questions at the same speed, but this time he had 6 hours. The question is asking how many questions he left incomplete in total.\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out how many questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test to find out how many were left incomplete. Then add those two numbers together for the total incomplete questions.\n\nStarting with the first test: 75 questions, 5 questions per hour, and 8 hours. So, if he works at 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, how many questions does he complete? That would be 5 multiplied by 8. Let me calculate that: 5 * 8 = 40. So he completed 40 questions in the first test. But wait, the test had 75 questions. So the number of incomplete questions would be 75 - 40 = 35. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow the second test: 100 questions, same speed of 5 questions per hour, but only 6 hours. So again, 5 * 6 = 30 questions completed. Therefore, the incomplete questions here would be 100 - 30 = 70. \n\nAdding both incomplete numbers: 35 (from the first test) + 70 (from the second test) = 105. So the total number of questions left incomplete is 105. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFirst test: 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions done. Total questions 75, so 75 - 40 = 35 incomplete. That's correct.\n\nSecond test: 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions done. Total questions 100, so 100 - 30 = 70 incomplete. Adding 35 + 70 gives 105. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"wie viele Fragen ließ er dann unvollständig?\" which translates to \"how many questions did he leave incomplete?\" So the answer should be 105. Hmm, but let me check if there's any trick here. For example, maybe the time he had was more than needed, but the question is about the number of questions he left incomplete, not the time he had left. So even if he had more time, if he only completed a certain number of questions, the rest are incomplete. So yes, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. Let me check the original question again:\n\n\"Mark machte gestern einen Test, der aus 75 Fragen bestand. Er vervollständigte den Test mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 5 Fragen pro Stunde. Heute machte er einen anderen Test mit 100 Fragen in der gleichen Geschwindigkeit. Wenn Mark 8 Stunden Zeit hatte, um den ersten, und 6 Stunden, um den zweiten Test zu vervollständigen, wie viele Fragen ließ er dann unvollständig?\"\n\nSo, \"er vervollständigte den Test mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 5 Fragen pro Stunde.\" Wait, does that mean he completed the test at a speed of 5 questions per hour, or that he worked at a speed of 5 questions per hour? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But the next sentence says \"in der gleichen Geschwindigkeit\" (at the same speed) for the second test. So it's likely that his speed was 5 questions per hour for both tests. So the initial interpretation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 35 + 70 = 105. So I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nMark löste gestern 75 Fragen in 8 Stunden mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 5 Fragen pro Stunde:  \n**75 - (5 × 8) = 75 - 40 = 35 unvollständige Fragen.**\n\nHeute löste er 100 Fragen in 6 Stunden mit der gleichen Geschwindigkeit:  \n**100 - (5 × 6) = 100 - 30 = 70 unvollständige Fragen.**\n\n**Gesamt unvollständige Fragen:**  \n**35 + 70 = 105.**\n\n**Antwort:** 105 Fragen wurden unvollständig gelassen."]], "filtered_resps": ["105"], "doc_hash": "e72f856431dffac9f5832d7226568b2be027eacbc9a5753c6bd4b1e9d6fd207a", "prompt_hash": "ef85d545c95eb4169be20e85e98222bb939a5e24748dad244ebd526d9294b12a", "target_hash": "1253e9373e781b7500266caa55150e08e210bc8cd8cc70d89985e3600155e860", "exact_match": 1.0}

The problem is about a gum ball machine with pink and blue gum balls. The question says there are 22 more pink gum balls than four times the number of blue ones. And we know there are 12 blue gum balls. We need to find out how many pink ones there are.\n\nAlright, so first, let me parse the sentence again. \"22 rosa Kaugummikugeln mehr als das Vierfache der Anzahl blauer Kaugummikugeln.\" Translating that to English, it's \"22 more pink gum balls than four times the number of blue gum balls.\" So, the number of pink gum balls is equal to four times the number of blue ones plus 22.\n\nGiven that there are 12 blue gum balls, so let me write that down. Let me denote the number of blue gum balls as B and pink as P. So, B = 12. The relationship between P and B is given by the equation P = 4*B + 22.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The problem says \"22 mehr als das Vierfache der Anzahl blauer.\" So, \"more than four times the number of blue.\" So yes, that would be P = 4*B + 22. So substituting B = 12 into that equation.\n\nCalculating 4 times 12: 4*12 is 48. Then add 22: 48 + 22. Let me do that addition. 48 + 20 is 68, plus 2 more is 70. So, 70 pink gum balls.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the original sentence. Sometimes \"more than\" can be tricky. For example, if it had said \"the number of pink is four times more than the blue,\" that could be ambiguous. But here it's \"22 more than four times the number of blue,\" which is pretty clear. So four times the number of blue is 4*12=48, then add 22, so 70. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought \"four times more than\" means multiplying by four, but in this case, the wording is \"22 more than four times,\" so it's definitely 4*B +22. So I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be 70.\n</think>\n\nDie Anzahl der rosa Kaugummikugeln wird durch die Gleichung $ P = 4 \\cdot B + 22 $ beschrieben, wobei $ B = 12 $ (blau) ist. \n\nBerechnung:\n$$\nP = 4 \\cdot 12 + 22 = 48 + 22 = 70\n$$\n\n**Antwort:** Es gibt 70 rosa Kaugummikugeln."]], "filtered_resps": ["70"], "doc_hash": "c8c0b438dd7aaa42190b56c73ad0c48825f79dea4ac0874115fb7cf968710c29", "prompt_hash": "be989de51b6321ccf1c1d78aac2ce6e220c2a94f66f3988d6159722a38ea2eff", "target_hash": "ff5a1ae012afa5d4c889c50ad427aaf545d31a4fac04ffc1c4d03d403ba4250a", "exact_match": 1.0}

The problem is about calculating the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of 20 available rental cars. So, there are 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the rest are semi-automatic. I need to find out what percentage of the total cars are semi-automatic.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many semi-automatic cars there are. The total number of cars is 20. If 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, then the remaining cars must be semi-automatic. So, I can subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total to get the number of semi-automatic ones.\n\nLet me write that down: Total cars = 20. Automatic = 12, Manual = 4. So, Semi-automatic = Total - Automatic - Manual. That would be 20 - 12 - 4. Let me calculate that. 20 minus 12 is 8, and then 8 minus 4 is 4. So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.\n\nNow, to find the percentage, I need to take the number of semi-automatic cars (which is 4) and divide it by the total number of cars (20), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. The formula for percentage is (Part / Whole) * 100.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: (4 / 20) * 100. Let me compute that. 4 divided by 20 is 0.2. Then, 0.2 multiplied by 100 is 20. So, 20%.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, that's 16 cars. Then the remaining 4 are semi-automatic. Yes, that adds up to 20. So 4 out of 20 is indeed 20%. That seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. The calculation is straightforward. Maybe I can cross-verify by thinking about fractions. 4/20 simplifies to 1/5, and 1/5 as a percentage is 20%. Yep, that checks out.

I need to find out how many worker bees there are.\n\nHmm, so first, maybe I should define variables for each type of bee. Let me think. Let's say the number of queens is Q. Then, since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of baby bees would be 2Q. And then, the worker bees are twice the number of baby bees, so that would be 2*(2Q) = 4Q. \n\nSo, total bees would be queens + babies + workers. That would be Q + 2Q + 4Q. Let me add those up: Q + 2Q is 3Q, plus 4Q is 7Q. And the total is 700 bees. So 7Q = 700. Then, solving for Q, divide both sides by 7: Q = 100. \n\nSo, the number of queens is 100. Then, the number of baby bees is 2Q = 200. And the worker bees are 4Q = 400. Let me check if that adds up: 100 + 200 + 400 = 700. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be 400 worker bees.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any of the relationships.

John buys several items, and I need to calculate the total cost considering a 10% tax on non-food items. Hmm, first, I should figure out which items are considered food and which are not. The problem mentions that there's a 10% tax on non-food items. So, I need to categorize each item as either food or non-food.\n\nLooking at the list: milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. Milk and eggs are definitely food items. Light bulbs, cups, and roach traps... Well, light bulbs are household items, cups could be considered kitchenware, but maybe they're for drinking, so maybe they're food-related? Wait, but cups are usually non-food. Roach traps are definitely non-food. So, the non-food items here are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The food items are milk and eggs.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. Sometimes, cups might be considered as food if they're used for serving food, but in general, they are non-food items. So, I think the non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. Let me confirm that. Yes, light bulbs are electronics, cups are kitchenware, and roach traps are pest control items. All non-food.\n\nSo, the prices are: milk $2, eggs $3, light bulbs $3, cups $3, roach traps $4. Now, the tax applies to non-food items, which are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. So, I need to calculate the tax on those three items and add them to the total.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of food items: milk ($2) + eggs ($3) = $5. Then, the non-food items: light bulbs ($3) + cups ($3) + roach traps ($4) = $10. Now, apply 10% tax to the non-food items. 10% of $10 is $1. So, the total cost would be the sum of food items plus non-food items plus tax. That would be $5 + $10 + $1 = $16.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is the tax applied to the non-food items only, so the $10 becomes $11, and then total is $5 + $11 = $16. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the tax is calculated on each non-food item individually. Let me check that. If I do each non-food item:\n\nLight bulbs: $3 + 10% tax = $3.30\n\nCups: $3 + 10% tax = $3.30\n\nRoach traps: $4 + 10% tax = $4.40\n\nTotal non-food with tax: 3.30 + 3.30 + 4.40 = $11.00\n\nThen food items: $2 + $3 = $5.00\n\nTotal overall: $5 + $11 = $16.00.

Alternatively, maybe Lucas is another person, but the problem only mentions Kim. Hmm. Well, regardless, the calculation is based on the given numbers, so maybe the name is irrelevant. Let's focus on the numbers.\n\nSo, total customers: 3 existing + 5 potential = 8 customers.\n\nEach customer requires 2 bleach bottles and 1 pack of rags.\n\nCost per bleach bottle: $2.\n\nCost per pack of rags: $5.\n\nTotal expenses would be (number of bleach bottles * $2) + (number of rags packs * $5).\n\nNumber of bleach bottles: 8 customers * 2 bottles = 16 bottles.\n\nNumber of rags packs: 8 customers * 1 pack = 8 packs.\n\nTotal expenses: (16 * 2) + (8 * 5) = 32 + 40 = $72.\n\nTotal income is given as $92 per week.\n\nProfit = Total income - Total expenses = 92 - 72 = $20.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Gesamteinkommen 92 $ pro Woche betragen wird.\" So total income is $92. The expenses are calculated as $72. So profit is 92 - 72 = $20. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify the number of customers again. The original question says: \"Er hat bereits 3 Kunden, spricht aber gerade mit 5 potenziellen Kunden und ist optimistisch genug, um sie in seine Berechnung aufzunehmen.\" So he already has 3 customers, but is talking to 5 potential ones and includes them in his calculation. So total customers considered are 3 + 5 = 8. That's correct.\n\nEach customer needs 2 bleach bottles and 1 pack of rags. So per customer, the cost is 2*2 + 1*5 = 4 + 5 = $9 per customer. For 8 customers, that's 8*9 = $72. Yes, same as before.\n\nTotal income is $92. So profit is 92 - 72 = $20. Therefore, the answer should be $20.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"Gewinn ist die Differenz zwischen Gesamteinkommen und Gesamtausgaben.\" So profit is total income minus total expenses. So yes, 92 - 72 = 20. That seems right.\n\nI think that's it. The answer is $20.\n</think>\n\nKim berechnet seinen Gewinn, indem er die Gesamtausgaben von seinem Gesamteinkommen abzieht. \n\n**Schritt 1: Anzahl der Kunden**  \nKim hat 3 bestehende Kunden und rechnet mit 5 potenziellen Kunden, also insgesamt:  \n$ 3 + 5 = 8 $ Kunden.\n\n**Schritt 2: Ausgaben pro Kunde**  \nJeder Kunde benötigt:  \n- 2 Flaschen Bleichmittel à $2 → $ 2 \\times 2 = 4 $ USD  \n- 1 Packung Lappen à $5 → $ 1 \\times 5 = 5 $ USD  \nGesamtausgaben pro Kunde: $ 4 + 5 = 9 $ USD.\n\n**Schritt 3: Gesamtausgaben für alle Kunden**  \nFür 8 Kunden:  \n$ 8 \\times 9 = 72 $ USD.\n\n**Schritt 4: Gewinnberechnung**  \nGesamteinkommen: $ 92 $ USD  \nGewinn = Gesamteinkommen – Gesamtausgaben:  \n$ 92 - 72 = 20 $ USD.\n\n**Antwort:**  \nLucas (oder Kim) macht jede Woche **20 $** Gewinn.  \n\n$\\boxed{20}$"]], "filtered_resps": ["20"], "doc_hash": "407b95a0f6582740f9bae2adbadeca2030d64db4405fb33c159945f833e34747", "prompt_hash": "ecb4220422f3bdab3e03b2cac667ebb18a45fbe3900dc7e430faa8a9489b6261", "target_hash": "f5ca38f748a1d6eaf726b8a42fb575c3c71f1864a8143301782de13da2d9202b", "exact_match": 1.0}

John has a pineapple field that's 10 hectares. Each hectare has 100 pineapples. He can harvest all of them every 3 months. The question is, how many pineapples can he harvest in a year?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many times he can harvest in a year. Since a year has 12 months, and he harvests every 3 months, that would be 12 divided by 3. Let me do that calculation: 12 / 3 = 4. So he can harvest 4 times a year.\n\nNow, each time he harvests, he gets 10 hectares multiplied by 100 pineapples per hectare. Let me calculate that: 10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples per harvest.\n\nThen, if he does that 4 times a year, it's 1000 * 4. That would be 4000 pineapples in total for the year.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no trick here. The problem says he can harvest all of them every 3 months.

Johnny is cleaning up his room and he has three different Lego sets. The first one is a packed set with 500 pieces. Then there's another one that has three times as many pieces as the 500-piece one. And the third one has a quarter of the number of pieces. I need to find out how many blocks Johnny is picking up in total.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. The first set is straightforward: 500 pieces. The second set is three times that. So 3 times 500. Let me calculate that. 3 * 500 is 1500. Okay, so the second set has 1500 pieces.\n\nThen the third set is a quarter of the number of pieces. Wait, a quarter of which set? The question says \"der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" Hmm, the original German might be clearer. The original question says: \"einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" So \"another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.\" But which number? The previous one was 500, and the second one was 3 times that. But the third one is 1/4 of the number. Maybe it's 1/4 of the first set? Or 1/4 of the second set?\n\nWait, the original question in German: \"Er hat einen verpackten Lego-Bausatz mit 500 Teilen auf den Boden geschüttet und einen anderen, der 3 Mal so viele Teile hatte wie der 500-teilige, und einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" So the first is 500, the second is 3 times as many as the 500, and the third is 1/4 the number of pieces. The \"der Anzahl\" here probably refers to the number of pieces of the first set, which is 500. Because the second set is 3 times the first, and the third is 1/4 of the number. So maybe 1/4 of the first set's 500 pieces. So 500 divided by 4 is 125. So the third set has 125 pieces.\n\nSo total pieces would be 500 + 1500 + 125. Let me add those up. 500 + 1500 is 2000, and 2000 + 125 is 2125. So Johnny is picking up 2125 blocks in total.\n\nWait, but maybe the third set is 1/4 of the second set? Let me check again. The original says: \"einen anderen, der 3 Mal so viele Teile hatte wie der 500-teilige, und einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" The structure is: first set (500), second set (3x the first), third set (1/4 the number). The \"der Anzahl\" here is a bit ambiguous. If it's \"der Anzahl Teile\" without a reference, it might refer to the previous one, which is the second set. But that would be 1/4 of 1500, which is 375. But that would make the third set 375. But the original German might have a clearer structure. Let me think again.\n\nIn German, when you say \"einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte,\" the \"der Anzahl\" could be referring to the number of pieces of the first set, since the second set is already defined as 3 times the first. So maybe the third set is 1/4 of the first set's 500. That would be 125. Alternatively, if it's 1/4 of the second set's 1500, that's 375. But the way the sentence is structured, after mentioning the second set, the third set is introduced with \"und einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" The \"der Anzahl\" might be referring to the number of pieces of the first set, which is 500. Because the second set is already defined as 3 times the first, so the third is 1/4 of the first. That seems more logical. Otherwise, if it's 1/4 of the second set, the sentence might have said \"1/4 der Anzahl Teile des anderen\" or something like that. So I think it's 1/4 of the first set's 500, which is 125. Therefore, total is 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both possibilities. If the third set is 1/4 of the second set (1500), then 1500 / 4 = 375. Then total would be 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375. But which is correct?\n\nLooking back at the original question: \"einen anderen, der 3 Mal so viele Teile hatte wie der 500-teilige, und einen anderen, der 1/4 der Anzahl Teile hatte.\" The structure is: first set (500), second set (3x the 500), third set (1/4 the number). The \"der Anzahl\" here is likely referring to the number of pieces of the first set, because the second set is already defined as 3x the first. If it were referring to the second set, the sentence might have said \"1/4 der Anzahl Teile des anderen\" (the other one). Since it's just \"der Anzahl Teile\", it's more natural to assume it's referring to the first set's number of pieces. Therefore, 1/4 of 500 is 125. So total is 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2125.\n</think>\n\nJohnny hebt insgesamt **2125** Legosteine auf. \n\n**Berechnung:**\n1. **Erster Bausatz:** 500 Teile.\n2. **Zweiter Bausatz:** 3 × 500 = **1500** Teile.\n3. **Dritter Bausatz:** 1/4 der Anzahl des ersten Bausatzes = 500 ÷ 4 = **125** Teile.\n\n**Gesamtanzahl:**  \n500 (erster) + 1500 (zweiter) + 125 (dritter) = **2125**. \n\n**Antwort:** 2125"]], "filtered_resps": ["2125"], "doc_hash": "c8964cde297f57aff75466d65793be5486e98e3f43a8e275d46284b45fe5b7d2", "prompt_hash": "53c7eff4ac245b58645485b674ea9a175e4d3221e8c2cdea1d10ea5b814da1bc", "target_hash": "43e8852bef636588d357c96ae642844aa7425d8fb73445cc4f017dbd6f5ab6e3", "exact_match": 1.0}

So, Debra is observing a beehive and counting the number of bees coming and going each day. The question is asking how many bees she saw returning to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, in the first 6 hours, she sees 30 bees leave the hive. Then, in the next 6 hours, she sees half as many bees returning. So, half of 30 is 15. That means 15 bees come back in the second 6-hour period.\n\nThen, in the next 6 hours (so that's the third 6-hour block), she sees twice as many bees leaving the hive as she did in the first 6 hours. The first time was 30 bees leaving, so twice that would be 60 bees leaving in the third period.\n\nNow, the next part says: \"Jede Biene, die davor weggeflogen und noch nicht zurückgekehrt war, kehrte dann in den nächsten 6 Stunden in den Bienenstock zurück.\" Translating that, it means every bee that had flown away before and hadn't returned yet came back in the next 6 hours. So, the last 6 hours (the fourth period) would have all the bees that had left previously but hadn't returned yet.\n\nSo, let's track the bees that have left and not returned yet. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst 6 hours: 30 bees leave. At this point, 30 bees have left and not returned yet.\n\nSecond 6 hours: 15 bees return. So, out of the initial 30 that left, 15 come back. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still away and haven't returned yet.\n\nThird 6 hours: 60 bees leave. Now, these are new bees leaving. So, the total number of bees that have left but not returned is the previous 15 (from the first period) plus the 60 that just left. So, 15 + 60 = 75 bees that are away and haven't returned yet.\n\nThen, in the next 6 hours (the fourth period), all of those 75 bees return. Therefore, Debra would see 75 bees returning in the last 6 hours.\n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. Let me rephrase:\n\n- First 6h: 30 leave. Total away: 30.\n- Next 6h: 15 return. So, 30 - 15 = 15 still away.\n- Next 6h: 60 leave. Now, total away is 15 + 60 = 75.\n- Then, in the last 6h, all 75 return. So, answer is 75?\n\nBut let me make sure there's no other interpretation. The problem says \"Jede Biene, die davor weggeflogen und noch nicht zurückgekehrt war, kehrte dann in den nächsten 6 Stunden in den Bienenstock zurück.\" So \"davor\" refers to before this last period. So, before the last 6 hours, which would be all the bees that had left in previous periods but hadn't returned yet. That would be the 15 from the first period that hadn't returned, plus the 60 that left in the third period. So yes, 15 + 60 = 75. Therefore, 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a misunderstanding about the timing? Let me check the timeline again:\n\n- First 6h: 30 leave.\n- Next 6h (second period): 15 return.\n- Next 6h (third period): 60 leave.\n- Next 6h (fourth period): all previous non-returning bees return.\n\nYes, that seems to be the structure. So the answer should be 75. Let me check if there's any other possible way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe the \"davor\" refers to before the third period? But no, the sentence says \"in den nächsten 6 Stunden\" (in the next 6 hours) after the third period. So the fourth period is after the third, and during that time, all bees that had flown away before (i.e., in the first, second, or third periods) but hadn't returned yet come back. Wait, but in the second period, 15 returned. So the ones that had flown away before (i.e., in the first period) but hadn't returned yet were 15. Then in the third period, 60 left. So those 60 hadn't returned yet. So total is 15 + 60 = 75. Therefore, yes, 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.\n\nI think that's correct.

So the problem is about Brittany and her mom going to the museum. The ticket prices are $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom pays for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket, and she gets $8 in change. The question is, how much money did she give the cashier?\n\nAlright, first, I need to figure out the total cost of the two tickets. Since there's one adult ticket and one child ticket, that would be $12 plus $10. Let me add those together. 12 + 10 is 22. So the total cost is $22.\n\nNow, Brittany's mom gave the cashier some money and got $8 back as change. So the amount she gave the cashier must be the total cost plus the change she received. Wait, no. Wait, if she got $8 in change, that means she gave the cashier more than the total cost. The formula here is: amount given = total cost + change received. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the change is the amount she gave minus the total cost. So if she got $8 back, that means she gave the cashier $8 more than the total cost. So, total cost is $22, and she got $8 back, so she must have given $22 + $8 = $30. Let me check that again.\n\nLet me think of it as: if the total cost is $22, and she received $8 in change, then the amount she paid is total cost plus change. Wait, no. Wait, if you pay with a certain amount and get change, the amount you paid is equal to the total cost plus the change. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think of an example. If something costs $10 and you give $15, you get $5 back. So the amount you gave is $15, which is the cost ($10) plus the change ($5). So yes, in that case, the amount given is total cost plus change. So applying that here, the total cost is $22, and she got $8 back, so she gave $22 + $8 = $30. Therefore, the answer should be $30.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Another way: the amount given minus the total cost equals the change. So, amount given = total cost + change. So yes, that's correct. So 22 + 8 = 30. So she gave $30 to the cashier.\n\nBut let me check again. If the total is $22, and she gave $30, then the change would be 30 - 22 = 8, which matches the problem statement. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is $30.\n\nI think that's straightforward.

Since Charlie has three times Dorothy's friends, and Charlie has 12, I can set up an equation. Let me call Dorothy's friends D. Then Charlie's friends would be 3D. And we know that 3D equals 12.

Since D is 4, that's 4 * 4 = 16. So James has 16 friends. Let me check that again. If Dorothy has 4, Charlie has 3*4=12, which matches the given info. James has 4*4=16. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The answer should be 16.\n</think>\n\nCharlie hat drei Mal so viele Freunde wie Dorothy.

So Steve and Tim are racing to see who gets home faster. Steve lives farther away, 3 miles from school, and he can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away and skates at 264 feet per minute. The question is, how long does the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how long each of them takes to get home. Then, the difference between their times will be how long the winner waits for the loser. But wait, the problem says \"wie lang wartet der Gewinner dann bei sich zu Hause, bevor der Verlierer das Rennen beendet?\" So, the winner arrives home first, and then waits until the loser arrives. So the time the winner waits is the difference between the loser's time and the winner's time.\n\nBut first, I need to convert the distances from miles to feet because their speeds are given in feet per minute. Let me recall that 1 mile is 5280 feet. So Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 3 * 5280 feet. Similarly, Tim's distance is 2 * 5280 feet.\n\nCalculating Steve's distance: 3 * 5280 = 15,840 feet. Tim's distance: 2 * 5280 = 10,560 feet.\n\nNow, time is distance divided by speed. So Steve's time is 15,840 feet divided by 440 feet per minute. Let me compute that. 15,840 / 440. Let's see, 440 * 36 = 15,840 because 440 * 30 = 13,200, 440 * 6 = 2,640; 13,200 + 2,640 = 15,840. So Steve takes 36 minutes.\n\nNow Tim's time: 10,560 feet divided by 264 feet per minute. Let me calculate that. 264 * 40 = 10,560. Because 264 * 10 = 2,640, so 2,640 * 4 = 10,560. So Tim takes 40 minutes.\n\nWait, so Steve takes 36 minutes, Tim takes 40 minutes. Therefore, Steve is the winner. He arrives home first. Then he waits until Tim arrives. The difference is 40 - 36 = 4 minutes. So the answer is 4 minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to be sure. For Steve: 3 miles is 3*5280=15,840 feet. Divided by 440 feet per minute. 15,840 / 440. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 10: 1584 / 44. Then divide numerator and denominator by 4: 396 / 11. 11*36=396. Yes, so 36 minutes. Correct.\n\nFor Tim: 2 miles is 10,560 feet. Divided by 264 feet per minute. 10,560 / 264. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 8: 10,560 /8=1320; 264 /8=33. So 1320 /33. 33*40=1320. So 40 minutes. Correct.\n\nSo the difference is 4 minutes. Therefore, the winner (Steve) waits 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes. So the answer is 4 minutes. That seems straightforward. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was converting miles to feet and then computing the time correctly. The speeds are given in feet per minute, so the units match once the distance is in feet. Yep, that all checks out.\n</think>\n\nSteve und Tim fahren ein Rennen, um zu sehen, wer schneller zu Hause ist. \n\n**Schritt 1: Umrechnung der Entfernungen in Fuß**  \n- Steve wohnt **3 Meilen** von der Schule entfernt:  \n  $ 3 \\, \\text{Meilen} \\times 5280 \\, \\text{Fuß/Meile} = 15.840 \\, \\text{Fuß} $.  \n- Tim wohnt **2 Meilen** von der Schule entfernt:  \n  $ 2 \\, \\text{Meilen} \\times 5280 \\, \\text{Fuß/Meile} = 10.560 \\, \\text{Fuß} $.\n\n**Schritt 2: Berechnung der benötigten Zeit**  \n- **Steve** fährt mit **440 Fuß/Minute**:  \n  $ \\frac{15.840 \\, \\text{Fuß}}{440 \\, \\text{Fuß/Minute}} = 36 \\, \\text{Minuten} $.  \n- **Tim** fährt mit **264 Fuß/Minute**:  \n  $ \\frac{10.560 \\, \\text{Fuß}}{264 \\, \\text{Fuß/Minute}} = 40 \\, \\text{Minuten} $.\n\n**Schritt 3: Zeitdifferenz**  \nSteve benötigt **36 Minuten**, Tim **40 Minuten**.

Shawnda is running a bike pump service, charging 25 cents per tire. I need to figure out how much she made in total on the first day. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, there are different types of bikes mentioned: bicycles, tricycles, and a unicycle. Each of these has a different number of tires. So, I need to calculate the number of tires pumped for each type of bike and then multiply by the cost per tire.\n\nStarting with the first part: 5 people came with bicycles, and they wanted both tires pumped. A bicycle has 2 tires, right? So each of those 5 people would have 2 tires. That would be 5 people * 2 tires = 10 tires. At 25 cents each, that's 10 * $0.25. Let me calculate that: 10 * 0.25 = $2.50. Okay, so that's $2.50 from the bicycles.\n\nNext, 3 people came with tricycles. A tricycle has 3 tires. So each of those 3 people would have 3 tires. That's 3 * 3 = 9 tires. Then, 9 tires * $0.25 = $2.25. So that's another $2.25 from the tricycles.\n\nThen, there's one person on a unicycle. A unicycle has 1 tire. So that's 1 tire * $0.25 = $0.25. \n\nNow, adding all those amounts together: $2.50 (bicycles) + $2.25 (tricycles) + $0.25 (unicycle). Let me add them up. 2.50 + 2.25 is 4.75, and then adding 0.25 gives 5.00. So total is $5.00.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"pro Reifen abzurechnen\" which means per tire, so each tire is 25 cents. The numbers for each type of bike: 5 bikes with 2 tires each, 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, and 1 unicycle with 1 tire. Multiplying each by 0.25 and adding up. Yes, that seems right. 5*2=10, 3*3=9, 1*1=1. Total tires: 10+9+1=20. 20 tires * $0.25 = $5.00. Yep, that checks out.

Let me calculate that: 10 * 6 = 60 cookies. So, he's buying 60 cookies in total.\n\nNext, each cookie costs 0.10 dollars. So, the total cost would be the number of cookies multiplied by the price per cookie. That's 60 * 0.10. Hmm, 60 times 0.10 is the same as 60 * 10 cents, which is 600 cents. Converting that back to dollars, 600 cents is 6 dollars. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 0.10 dollars per cookie, so 60 cookies would be 60 * 0.10 = 6.00 dollars. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total cost is $6.00. Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount paid. That's 10.00 - 6.00 = 4.00 dollars.

Hmm, the problem has several steps, so I need to break it down step by step. Let me start by listing out all the events and what happened with the fries each time.\n\nFirst, Dave bought a large bag of fries. Then he ate 14 of them before a seagull stole the bag. So, initially, there's some number of fries, let's call that number X. Dave eats 14, so the remaining fries after that would be X - 14.\n\nNext, the seagull lands and eats half as many as Dave had eaten. Dave ate 14, so half of that is 7. So the seagull eats 7 fries. That means after the seagull, the remaining fries would be (X - 14) - 7 = X - 21.\n\nThen, three pigeons come and push the seagull away. Each pigeon eats 3 fries. So three pigeons would eat 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Subtracting that from the remaining fries: (X - 21) - 9 = X - 30.\n\nAfter that, a raccoon steals two-thirds of the remaining fries. So if there were X - 30 fries left before the raccoon, the raccoon takes 2/3 of that. That means the remaining fries after the raccoon would be 1/3 of (X - 30). So that's (X - 30) * (1/3) = (X - 30)/3.\n\nThen, ants carry away one last fry, leaving 5 behind. So after the raccoon, there were (X - 30)/3 fries. The ants take 1, so the remaining is (X - 30)/3 - 1 = 5.\n\nNow, I can set up the equation:\n\n(X - 30)/3 - 1 = 5\n\nLet me solve this equation step by step. First, add 1 to both sides:\n\n(X - 30)/3 = 6\n\nThen multiply both sides by 3:\n\nX - 30 = 18\n\nThen add 30 to both sides:\n\nX = 48\n\nWait, so the original number of fries was 48? Let me check if that makes sense by going through each step again with X = 48.\n\nStart with 48 fries.\n\nDave eats 14: 48 - 14 = 34 left.\n\nSeagull eats half of 14, which is 7: 34 - 7 = 27 left.\n\nThree pigeons each eat 3: 3*3=9, so 27 - 9 = 18 left.\n\nRaccoon takes two-thirds of 18: 2/3 * 18 = 12, so remaining is 18 - 12 = 6.\n\nThen ants take 1, leaving 5. Which matches the problem statement. So yes, 48 seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the raccoon part again. If there were 18 fries before the raccoon, and the raccoon takes two-thirds, so 18 * (2/3) = 12 taken, leaving 6. Then ants take 1, leaving 5. That's correct. So the answer is 48.\n\nI think that's right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the steps. The equation setup seems correct. The key steps are:\n\nAfter Dave: X -14\n\nAfter seagull: X -14 -7 = X -21\n\nAfter pigeons: X -21 -9 = X -30\n\nAfter raccoon: (X -30) * (1/3)\n\nAfter ants: (X -30)/3 -1 =5\n\nSolving gives X=48.

Then, Tuesday and Thursday, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So that's 2 classes times 2 hours each, which would be 4 hours per day on those days.\n\nNow, the semester has 16 school weeks. So I need to calculate the total hours per week first and then multiply by 16.\n\nLet me check the days again. Monday, Wednesday, Friday: three days. Each day has 3 hours.

Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes each day. I need to find out the total length when all these pastries are placed end to end, and convert that into feet. Hmm, okay. First, I should figure out the length of each type of pastry and then multiply by the quantity. But wait, the units are different: rolls and croissants are in inches, and baguettes are in feet. So I need to convert everything to the same unit, probably feet, since the answer needs to be in feet.\n\nAlright, let's start with the rolls. Each roll is 4 inches long. There are 300 rolls. So total length for rolls would be 300 multiplied by 4 inches. Let me calculate that: 300 * 4 = 1200 inches. Now, convert inches to feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, divide by 12. 1200 / 12 = 100 feet. Okay, so rolls contribute 100 feet.\n\nNext, the chocolate croissants. Each is 6 inches long. There are 120 of them. So 120 * 6 inches. Let me do that: 120 * 6 = 720 inches. Convert to feet: 720 / 12 = 60 feet. So croissants add 60 feet.\n\nNow the baguettes. Each is two feet long. There are 60 baguettes. So 60 * 2 feet = 120 feet. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, add all three together: 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nRolls: 300 * 4 inches = 1200 inches. 1200 / 12 = 100 feet. Correct.\n\nCroissants: 120 * 6 inches = 720 inches. 720 / 12 = 60 feet. Correct.\n\nBaguettes: 60 * 2 feet = 120 feet. Correct.\n\nTotal: 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any units. The baguettes were already in feet, so no conversion needed there. The others were in inches, converted to feet. Yep, that's correct. So the total length is 280 feet.

The zookeeper needs to order bananas for two months. The problem says that every month, the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas 400, and the baboons 100. So first, I need to figure out the total number of bananas required per month and then multiply that by two for the two months.\n\nWait, but the question mentions that the zookeeper orders all the bananas every two months. So maybe I should calculate the monthly total first. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, per month:\n- Monkeys: 200 bananas\n- Gorillas: 400 bananas\n- Baboons: 100 bananas\n\nAdding those up: 200 + 400 + 100. Let me do the math. 200 plus 400 is 600, and then plus 100 makes 700 bananas per month.\n\nSince he needs to cover two months, I multiply the monthly total by 2. So 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"alle 2 Monate bestellt er alle Bananen\". So does that mean he orders once every two months, and that order has to cover two months' worth? So yes, that would be 700 per month times two, which is 1400. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. The problem states that the zookeeper feeds all the monkeys in the zoo. Then, every two months he orders all the bananas from a local farm. The question is how many bananas he needs to order to last two months.\n\nSo the key is that each month, the total consumption is 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700. For two months, that's 700 * 2 = 1400. So the answer should be 1400 bananas.\n\nI don't see any other factors here. The problem doesn't mention any changes in consumption over the two months or any other animals. So it's a simple multiplication.

So Blake and Kelly are having a race to see who can run the farthest in 15 minutes on a football field that's 100 yards long. The question is asking how much farther the winner runs compared to the loser. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how far each of them runs. Let me start with Blake. The problem says Blake runs 15 times back and forth. The football field is 100 yards long. So, when they say \"hin und zurück,\" that means going to the end and coming back, right? So each lap around the field would be going 100 yards to the end and then 100 yards back. So that's 200 yards per lap. If Blake does this 15 times, then his total distance would be 15 multiplied by 200 yards. Let me calculate that: 15 * 200 = 3000 yards. Okay, so Blake runs 3000 yards.\n\nNow, Kelly's part is a bit trickier. She first runs once back and forth, which is the same as Blake's first lap, right? So that's 100 yards there and 100 yards back, so 200 yards. Then she decides not to run next to Blake, so she starts running to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Wait, so the first time she runs once back and forth (the full 100 yards), and then she does 34 times the 40-yard line back and forth. Wait, does the 34 include the first one or is it in addition? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Kelly läuft einmal hin und zurück und beschließt dann, dass sie nicht neben Blake laufen will; also beginnt sie, zur 40-Yard-Linie und zurück zu laufen. Sie tut dies 34 Mal.\" So, she first runs once back and forth (the full 100 yards), and then she starts running to the 40-yard line and back, doing this 34 times. So the total for Kelly is 1 time of 200 yards (the first back and forth) plus 34 times of running to the 40-yard line and back. So each of those 34 times is 40 yards there and 40 yards back, which is 80 yards per lap. So 34 * 80 yards. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 34 * 80. Well, 30*80=2400, and 4*80=320, so total is 2400 + 320 = 2720 yards. Then add the initial 200 yards: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards. So Kelly runs 2920 yards in total.\n\nWait, but Blake ran 3000 yards. So Blake is the winner, and he ran 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards more than Kelly. So the answer would be 80 yards. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nBlake: 15 times back and forth on 100 yards. Each back and forth is 200 yards. 15*200=3000. That seems right.\n\nKelly: 1 time back and forth (200 yards) plus 34 times to the 40-yard line and back. Each of those is 40*2=80 yards. 34*80=2720. Then 2720 + 200 = 2920. Yes, that's correct. So 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards. So Blake wins by 80 yards.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem says \"15 Minuten\" but does the time affect the distance? Wait, the problem says they have 15 minutes to run as far as possible. But the question is about who runs farther, not about speed. So regardless of time, the total distance each ran is what's being compared. So even if they ran for the same amount of time, the one who ran more distance is the winner. So the answer is 80 yards.\n\nBut let me check again if I interpreted Kelly's running correctly. She first runs once back and forth (the full 100 yards), then she does 34 times to the 40-yard line and back. So that's 34 times. So total for Kelly is 200 + 34*80. Yes, that's 200 + 2720 = 2920. Blake is 3000. So difference is 80 yards. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. The original German says \"zur 40-Yard-Linie und zurück zu laufen. Sie tut dies 34 Mal.\" So \"zur 40-Yard-Linie und zurück\" is to the 40-yard line and back, so that's 40 yards there and 40 back, so 80 yards per loop. 34 loops would be 34*80. Then the initial one is 100 there and 100 back, 200. So total 2920. Blake is 3000. So 80 yards difference. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. The winner is Blake, and he runs 80 yards more than Kelly.\n</think>\n\nBlake und Kelly laufen in 15 Minuten so weit wie möglich. \n\n**Blakes Distanz:**  \nBlake läuft 15 Mal hin und zurück über die 100-Yard-Länge des Footballfelds.

So maybe all 11 are visible initially. Then, 6 come out from under a lily pad. Wait, if they were hiding under the lily pad, then when they come out, they become visible again.

Then \"plötzlich sieht er 6 von ihnen aus dem Versteck unter einem Seerosenblatt kommen.\" So those 6 were hiding under the lily pad and now come out. So before that, those 6 were not visible, right?

Maybe all 11 are visible at first. Then, 6 come out from under the lily pad. Wait, that might mean that those 6 were hiding and now they are visible.

Plötzlich sieht er 6 von ihnen aus dem Versteck unter einem Seerosenblatt kommen, dann sieht er 2 von ihnen unter einem Stein verschwinden. Wie viele Kaulquappen kann Finn jetzt im Teich sehen?\n\nSo, first, he observes 11 swimming tadpoles. Then, he sees 6 of them come out from a hiding place under a lily pad. Then, he sees 2 of them disappear under a rock. How many can he see now?\n\nSo, the key is whether the 6 that came out were previously hidden and thus not counted in the initial 11, or if they were part of the 11 that were already visible.\n\nIf the initial 11 are all visible, then when 6 come out from hiding, that would mean they were hidden before, so they were not part of the 11. But that would mean the total number of tadpoles is more than 11. But the problem doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the 6 were part of the 11 that were already visible, but they were hiding under the lily pad and then came out. Wait, but if they were already visible, why would they be hiding?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let's think of it as a math problem. Maybe the initial 11 are all visible. Then, 6 come out from hiding, which might mean they were hidden before, so they were not visible. So adding them to the visible count. Then, 2 disappear under a rock, so they are no longer visible. So the calculation would be: initial visible 11, plus 6 that come out (so 11 + 6 = 17), then minus 2 that disappear (17 - 2 = 15). But that would be 15. But that assumes that the 6 were not part of the initial 11. However, the problem says \"6 von ihnen\" (of them), meaning from the 11. So if they were part of the 11, then they were already visible, but they were hiding under the lily pad. So maybe they were hiding, so they were not visible, but then they come out, so they become visible again. So initially, 11 visible. Then, 6 were hiding, so they were not visible. Wait, but if they were part of the 11, then the initial count of 11 would include them, but if they were hiding, they wouldn't be visible. So maybe the initial 11 is the total number of tadpoles, and some are visible, some hidden. But the problem says \"Finn beobachtet 11 schwimmende Kaulquappen\", which translates to \"Finn observes 11 swimming tadpoles\". So maybe all 11 are visible at first. Then, 6 of them come out from a hiding place. Wait, but if they were already swimming, they wouldn't be hiding. Maybe the 6 were hiding under the lily pad and then come out to swim, so they become visible. So initially, there were 11 visible, but 6 were hiding under the lily pad. Wait, but that would mean the total number of tadpoles is 11 + 6 = 17? But the problem doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the 6 that came out were part of the 11 that were already visible, but they were hiding under the lily pad. So they were visible but hiding? That doesn't make sense. If they are hiding, they are not visible. So maybe the initial 11 includes both visible and hidden. But the problem says \"schwimmende\" (swimming), so maybe all 11 are swimming and visible. Then, 6 of them come out from a hiding place. Wait, that seems contradictory. If they are swimming, they can't be hiding under a lily pad. Maybe the 6 were hiding under the lily pad and then come out to swim, so they join the 11. So the total number of tadpoles would be 11 + 6 = 17, but the problem doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the 6 were part of the 11 that were already visible, but they were hiding under the lily pad, so they were not visible. So initially, 11 visible, but 6 were hiding, so the actual total is 11 + 6 = 17. Then, when they come out, they become visible, so visible becomes 11 + 6 = 17. Then, 2 disappear under a rock, so visible is 17 - 2 = 15. But this is assuming that the initial 11 visible includes some that are hiding, which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. The initial 11 are all visible. Then, 6 come out from hiding, which means they were not visible before, so adding 6 to the visible count. Then, 2 disappear, subtracting 2. So total visible is 11 + 6 - 2 = 15. But the problem says \"6 von ihnen\" (of them), meaning from the 11. So if they were part of the 11, then they were already visible, but they were hiding. That doesn't make sense. If they were hiding, they wouldn't be visible. So maybe the 6 were not part of the initial 11. But the problem says \"Finn beobachtet 11 schwimmende Kaulquappen... dann sieht er 6 von ihnen aus dem Versteck...\" So \"von ihnen\" refers to the 11. Therefore, the 6 were part of the 11. So they were hiding under the lily pad, which means they were not visible. So initially, there were 11 tadpoles, but 6 were hiding, so visible were 11 - 6 = 5. Then, they come out, so visible becomes 5 + 6 = 11. Then, 2 disappear under a rock, so visible is 11 - 2 = 9. But that would be 9. But this is assuming that the initial 11 includes both visible and hidden. However, the problem says \"Finn beobachtet 11 schwimmende Kaulquappen\", which might mean that all 11 are visible. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis is a common type of problem where the wording can be tricky. In many similar problems, when something comes out of hiding, it's added to the visible count, and when something disappears, it's subtracted. But the key is whether the 6 that came out were previously hidden and not counted in the initial 11 or part of the 11.\n\nIf we take the problem at face value: Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them (from the 11) come out from hiding. Wait, but if they were already visible, why would they be hiding? Maybe they were hiding under the lily pad and then come out to swim, so they were not visible before. So the initial 11 includes those 6 that were hiding. Wait, but if they were hiding, they wouldn't be part of the 11 visible. So maybe the total number of tadpoles is more than 11. But the problem doesn't mention that. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in German, and the translation might have nuances. \"Schwimmende Kaulquappen\" means swimming tadpoles, so they are visible. Then, 6 of them come out from a hiding place, which might mean they were hiding and now are visible. So if they were hiding, they were not part of the initial 11. So the initial 11 are visible, then 6 more come out, making 17, then 2 disappear, making 15. But the problem says \"6 von ihnen\" (of them), which refers to the 11. So that would mean the 6 were part of the 11. Therefore, they were hiding, so they were not visible. So initially, 11 tadpoles, but 6 were hiding, so visible were 5. Then, they come out, visible becomes 5 + 6 = 11. Then, 2 disappear, visible becomes 11 - 2 = 9. But this is assuming that the initial 11 includes both visible and hidden, which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be straightforward: initial 11, then 6 more appear (so 11 + 6 = 17), then 2 disappear (17 - 2 = 15). But the wording says \"6 von ihnen\" which would mean from the 11, not additional. So this is conflicting.\n\nI think the most logical interpretation is that the initial 11 are all visible. Then, 6 of them (from the 11) were hiding under the lily pad and come out, so they were not visible before. Wait, but if they were part of the 11, they should have been visible. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the problem might have a mistake, or the translation is off. Alternatively, maybe \"schwimmende\" doesn't mean all are visible, but that they are swimming, and some are hiding. But that's not clear.\n\nIn many similar math problems, when something comes out of hiding, it's added to the visible count, and when something disappears, it's subtracted. So if we take that approach, even if the wording is a bit confusing, the answer would be 11 + 6 - 2 = 15. But if the 6 were part of the 11, then it's 11 - 6 (hidden) + 6 (now visible) - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven that the problem is in German, and the translation might be precise, I think the intended answer is 11 + 6 - 2 = 15. Because the 6 are coming out from hiding, which would mean they were not visible before, so adding them to the initial 11. Then, 2 disappear, so subtract 2. So 15. But I'm not entirely sure due to the ambiguity in the wording.\n</think>\n\nFinn beobachtet zunächst 11 schwimmende Kaulquappen.

The problem is about Anakin and Locsin going to the beach and catching some sea creatures. I need to find out how many fish they caught in total. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. Then Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, 3 seahorses less, and 2 clownfish more. Wait, the question says \"Fische\" which is German for fish. But starfish and seahorses are not fish, they're invertebrates. But maybe in the context of the problem, they're just considering all the creatures as fish? Or maybe there's a translation error? Hmm, but the original question is in German, so maybe the user just used \"Fische\" to mean all the animals they caught. Or maybe it's a mistake. But I should check the original question again.\n\nThe original question says: \"Wie viele Fische konnten sie fangen?\" which translates to \"How many fish could they catch?\" But starfish (Seesterne) are not fish, they're echinoderms. Seahorses (Seepferdchen) are fish, technically, since they're bony fish. Clownfish (Clownfische) are also fish. So maybe the problem is using \"Fische\" in a broader sense, including all the animals they caught, even though some aren't technically fish. Or maybe it's a translation error and they meant \"Tiere\" (animals). But since the user provided the question in German, I should stick with that. So perhaps the problem is using \"Fische\" to mean all the creatures caught, even if some aren't fish. So I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, Anakin's catch: 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, so 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 3 seahorses less than Anakin, so 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses. 2 clownfish more than Anakin, so 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.\n\nNow, to find the total number of \"Fische\" (creatures) they caught, I need to add up all the numbers. Let's do that.\n\nAnakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19.\n\nLocsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.\n\nCombined total: 19 + 13 = 32.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Fische\", which might be a trick here. If we consider only actual fish, then starfish are not fish. So seahorses and clownfish are fish. So Anakin's fish would be 6 + 3 = 9. Locsin's fish would be 3 + 5 = 8. Total fish would be 9 + 8 = 17. But the problem might not be that strict. However, the original question is in German, and in German, \"Fische\" strictly refers to fish, so maybe the starfish and seahorses are not counted. But the problem mentions \"Fische\" but also includes starfish and seahorses. That's confusing.\n\nWait, the original question is in German, but the user wrote the question in German, but the answer is expected in English?

The problem is about calculating the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. The original price is 20 dollars. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out how many times the price increases in 36 months. Since the increase happens every two months, I can divide 36 by 2 to find the number of periods. That would be 18 periods. Wait, but each period is two months, so 36 divided by 2 is indeed 18. So there are 18 increases?\n\nWait, but hold on. The question says the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. So does that mean each time it's 20% of the original 20 dollars, or 20% of the current price? That's a crucial point. If it's 20% of the original price each time, then each increase is a fixed amount. But if it's 20% of the current price, then it's a compound increase. The wording says \"20 % des ursprünglichen Preises\", which translates to \"20% of the original price\". So that would be a fixed amount added each time, not a percentage of the current price. So that's different from compound interest, which is a percentage of the current amount.\n\nSo, original price is 20. Each two months, the price increases by 20% of 20, which is 4 dollars. So every two months, the price goes up by 4 dollars. Therefore, after each two-month period, the price is original price plus 4 dollars. So after 1 period (2 months), it's 20 + 4 = 24. After 2 periods (4 months), 24 + 4 = 28. And so on. So after n periods, the price would be 20 + 4n. Since there are 18 periods in 36 months, the price would be 20 + 4*18. Let me calculate that: 4*18 is 72, so 20 + 72 = 92. So the price after 36 months would be 92 dollars.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If the increase is 20% of the original price each time, then each increase is 20% of 20, which is 4. So every two months, add 4. So over 36 months, which is 18 two-month periods, adding 4 each time. So total increase is 18*4 = 72, added to original 20, gives 92. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut another way to think about it: if the problem had said the price increases by 20% every two months, meaning 20% of the current price, then it would be compound growth. But the problem specifically says \"20 % des ursprünglichen Preises\", so original price. So that's a linear increase, not exponential. So the answer is 92.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Suppose the original price is 20. After 2 months: 20 + 0.20*20 = 24. After 4 months: 24 + 0.20*20 = 28. After 6 months: 28 + 4 = 32. So each time, adding 4. So after 18 times, 20 + 18*4 = 92. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if it were 20% of the current price each time, then it would be 20*(1.2)^n, where n is the number of periods. But since the problem says 20% of the original price, it's not compounding. So the answer is 92. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nDer Preis des Beutels Murmeln steigt alle zwei Monate um 20 % des ursprünglichen Preises (20 €). Jeder Anstieg beträgt daher $ 0{,}20 \\times 20 = 4 $ €.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the items and their quantities. There are 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll. The red cars are each $4. The action figures are each $5. The doll's price is equal to 3 action figures. So, since each action figure is $5, then 3 action figures would be 3 times $5, right? Let me calculate that: 3 * 5 = $15. So the doll is worth $15.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total cost of all the toys. Let's do each category one by one.\n\nStarting with the red cars: 5 cars at $4 each. So 5 * 4 = $20. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the action figures: 3 action figures at $5 each. So 3 * 5 = $15. Wait, but the doll is also $15. So maybe I need to check if I'm not double-counting something? No, the doll is a separate item, so the action figures and the doll are different. So the action figures are $15 and the doll is another $15. But wait, the problem says the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. So that's already accounted for by the $15. So the action figures are 3 * $5 = $15, and the doll is $15. So that's correct.\n\nSo adding them all up: red cars ($20) + action figures ($15) + doll ($15). Let me add those numbers. 20 + 15 is 35, and 35 + 15 is 50. So the total value is $50?\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the doll's price. The problem says the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since each action figure is $5, 3 of them would be 3*5=15. So the doll is $15. That's correct. Then the red cars are 5*4=20. The action figures are 3*5=15. So 20+15+15=50. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any other information.

Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her own tax return or hire an accountant. The question is asking how much more money she'll have if she hires the accountant instead of doing it herself. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the costs and benefits of each option. If she does it herself, she loses 3 hours of freelance work. Her hourly rate is $35, so the lost income would be 3 hours multiplied by $35 per hour. Let me calculate that: 3 * 35 = $105. So, by doing her own taxes, she loses $105 in potential earnings.\n\nOn the other hand, if she hires an accountant, she has to pay $90. So, the cost of hiring the accountant is $90. \n\nNow, the question is asking how much more money she'll have by hiring the accountant. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. If she hires the accountant, she pays $90 but saves the $105 she would have lost by not working. So, actually, the net difference would be the amount she saves by not losing the $105 minus the $90 she pays the accountant. \n\nLet me think again. If she does it herself, she loses $105. If she hires the accountant, she pays $90 but doesn't lose the $105. So, the difference is the $105 she saves minus the $90 she pays. That would be $105 - $90 = $15. So, she would have $15 more by hiring the accountant. \n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"wie viel mehr Geld wird sie haben, wenn sie den Buchhalter beauftragt?\" which translates to \"how much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?\" So, compared to doing it herself, hiring the accountant costs $90 but saves her $105. So, the net gain is $105 - $90 = $15. Therefore, she would have $15 more by hiring the accountant. \n\nBut let me double-check. If she does it herself, her net loss is $105.

Elvira has a budget of 1500 euros for her new computer and accessories, and she wants to buy some clothes with the leftover money. So, I need to calculate how much she spends on the computer and the accessories, then subtract that from 1500 to find out how much she has left for clothes.\n\nFirst, the computer itself costs 1090 euros, which includes the monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Then she adds a scanner for 157 euros, a CD burner for 74 euros, and a printer for 102 euros. I need to add all these amounts together.\n\nLet me start by adding the computer's cost to the other accessories. So 1090 plus 157. Let me do that step by step. 1090 + 150 is 1240, and then +7 is 1247. Then add the CD burner: 1247 + 74. Hmm, 1247 + 70 is 1317, then +4 is 1321. Next, add the printer: 1321 + 102. That would be 1321 + 100 = 1421, then +2 = 1423. So total cost is 1423 euros?\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the addition. Let's break it down:\n\nComputer: 1090\nScanner: 157\nCD-Brenner: 74\nDrucker: 102\n\nAdding them all together: 1090 + 157 = 1247. Then 1247 + 74 = 1321. Then 1321 + 102 = 1423. Yes, that seems right. So total expenditure is 1423 euros.\n\nNow subtract that from her budget of 1500. 1500 - 1423. Let's calculate that. 1500 - 1400 is 100, then subtract the remaining 23: 100 - 23 = 77. So she would have 77 euros left for clothes.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. 1090 + 157 is indeed 1247. Then 1247 + 74: 1247 + 70 is 1317, plus 4 is 1321. Then 1321 + 102: 1321 + 100 is 1421, plus 2 is 1423. Yes. Then 1500 - 1423 is 77.

The problem says Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In two years, the sum of their ages will be 28. I need to find out how old Seth is now. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me assign variables to their current ages. Let's say Brooke's current age is B. Then, since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age would be 2B. That makes sense because if Brooke is, say, 10, Seth would be 20. So, the relationship is straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that in two years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, I need to consider their ages two years from now. In two years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be 2B + 2. The sum of these two future ages is 28. So, I can write an equation for that.\n\nThe equation would be: (Brooke's age in 2 years) + (Seth's age in 2 years) = 28. Substituting the variables, that's (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28. Let me check that again. Yes, that seems right. Adding their future ages together equals 28.\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation. Combine like terms. B + 2B is 3B, and 2 + 2 is 4. So, the equation becomes 3B + 4 = 28. To solve for B, I need to isolate it. Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 28 - 4, which is 24. Then divide both sides by 3: B = 24 / 3 = 8. So, Brooke is currently 8 years old.\n\nSince Seth is twice as old as Brooke, his current age is 2 * B = 2 * 8 = 16. Let me verify this to make sure. In two years, Brooke will be 8 + 2 = 10, and Seth will be 16 + 2 = 18. Adding those together: 10 + 18 = 28. That matches the given information. So, the answer should be 16.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps again. Assigning variables correctly? Yes, Brooke is B, Seth is 2B. Future ages: B+2 and 2B+2. Sum is 28. Equation: (B+2)+(2B+2)=28. Simplify: 3B +4=28. Subtract 4: 3B=24. Divide by 3: B=8. Seth is 2*8=16. Check future ages: 10 and 18, sum 28. Yep, that's correct. I think that's solid. No mistakes here.

The original German says \"2 $ mehr als doppelt so viel Geld wie Ethel.\" So \"mehr als\" is \"more than,\" and \"doppelt so viel\" is \"twice as much.\" So yes, the structure is \"Jimmy has (2 more than twice Ethel's amount).\" So the calculation seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write an equation.

So, I need to find the total cost of one uniform by adding up the costs of these three items.\n\nFirst, let me break down each component. The hat is straightforward: $25. The jacket is three times the cost of the hat. So, if the hat is $25, then the jacket would be 3 * $25. Let me calculate that: 3 * 25 is 75. So the jacket is $75.\n\nNext, the pants cost the average of the hat and the jacket. To find the average, I need to add the prices of the hat and the jacket together and then divide by 2.

Let me add them step by step. 640 + 540 is... 640 + 500 is 1140, and then +40 more is 1180. Then add the 30 from the invertebrates: 1180 + 30 = 1210. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 640 + 540. Let me do it another way. 600 + 500 is 1100, and 40 + 40 is 80, so total 1180. Then 1180 + 30 is indeed 1210. So the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210.\n\nI think that's all. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any numbers. The problem mentions 80 spiders, 90 insects, 3 invertebrates. Each group's legs are calculated correctly. Spiders 8 legs, insects 6, invertebrates 10. Multiplications seem right. 80*8=640, 90*6=540, 3*10=30. Summing them gives 1210.

Let me check again.\n\nOriginal German: \"Wenn Sally Four gleich alt ist wie Sally Thirtytwo und Sally Thirtytwo 8 Jahre älter, wie hoch ist dann das Gesamtalter der vier Vögel?\"\n\nSo, the structure is: If Sally Four is as old as Sally Thirtytwo and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years older, then what is the total age of the four birds?\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe it's a translation issue. Let me parse it again. The original might be saying that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years older than someone else. But who? The sentence is a bit unclear. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last part is that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years older than Sally Four? But the first part says Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. That would be a contradiction unless both are 8 years older than themselves, which doesn't make sense.

So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original meant that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years older than someone else, but the translation is missing that someone.

Billy needs to prepare 60 potatoes for his family barbecue. The question is asking how long it will take him to do all the peeling and cutting. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the time for each potato. The problem says it takes him one and a half minutes to peel each potato. Wait, one and a half minutes is 1 minute and 30 seconds, right? So that's 90 seconds per potato for peeling. Then, cutting each potato takes only 5 seconds. So for each potato, the total time is 90 seconds plus 5 seconds. That would be 95 seconds per potato.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Is there any chance that the peeling and cutting can be done in parallel? Like, maybe he can peel one potato while cutting another? But the problem doesn't mention anything about multitasking. It just says he's peeling and cutting each potato. So I think we have to assume that he does each potato one after the other, first peeling and then cutting. So for each potato, it's 90 seconds plus 5 seconds, totaling 95 seconds per potato.\n\nSo if he has 60 potatoes, then the total time would be 60 multiplied by 95 seconds. Let me calculate that. 60 times 95. Hmm, 60 times 100 is 6000, minus 60 times 5 which is 300, so 6000 - 300 = 5700 seconds. \n\nNow, converting that into minutes. Since 60 seconds make a minute, 5700 divided by 60. Let me do that division. 5700 divided by 60. Well, 60 times 95 is 5700, so that's 95 minutes. Wait, that's interesting. Because 60 potatoes times 95 seconds each is 5700 seconds, which is 95 minutes. So the total time is 95 minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's see: 95 seconds per potato. 60 potatoes. 95 * 60. Let's break it down. 90 * 60 = 5400 seconds, and 5 * 60 = 300 seconds. So 5400 + 300 = 5700 seconds. Yes, that's correct. Then 5700 divided by 60 is indeed 95 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in hours and minutes? 95 minutes is 1 hour and 35 minutes. But the question just asks for the time, so either 95 minutes or 1 hour 35 minutes. But since the original times were given in minutes and seconds, probably 95 minutes is acceptable. \n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. It says \"eineinhalb Minuten\" for peeling, which is 1.5 minutes, and 5 seconds for cutting. So per potato, 1.5 minutes plus 5 seconds. But 1.5 minutes is 90 seconds, so 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. So that's correct. \n\nAnother way: 1.5 minutes per potato for peeling. So 1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes. Then 5 seconds per potato for cutting. 5 seconds * 60 = 300 seconds. Convert that to minutes: 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. So total time is 90 + 5 = 95 minutes. Yep, same result. \n\nSo the answer should be 95 minutes. That seems straightforward. I don't see any tricks here. The key is to convert all times to the same unit, either all seconds or all minutes. Since the peeling time is given in minutes and the cutting in seconds, converting to seconds makes the calculation easier. But either way, the result is the same. \n\nI think that's it. So Billy needs 95 minutes to prepare all the potatoes.\n</think>\n\nBilly benötigt für jede Kartoffel 1,5 Minuten (90 Sekunden) zum Schälen und 5 Sekunden zum Schneiden.

The question is asking how much they spent on lemons if they made a $25 profit. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down all the given information. The cost for each gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. So the total cost per gallon would be $3 + $2 = $5. Then, they sell each glass for $0.50, and they get 20 glasses per gallon. So, per gallon, their revenue would be 20 glasses * $0.50 per glass. Let me calculate that: 20 * 0.50 = $10 per gallon. \n\nSo, for each gallon they make, they spend $5 and earn $10, which would give them a profit of $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon. Wait, but the problem says they made a $25 profit. If each gallon gives them $5 profit, then the number of gallons they sold would be $25 divided by $5 per gallon, which is 5 gallons. \n\nBut the question is asking how much they spent on lemons. Since each gallon costs $3 for lemons, then for 5 gallons, the total cost for lemons would be 5 * $3 = $15. So the answer should be $15. \n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake. \n\nTotal cost per gallon: $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5. Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50 = $10. Profit per gallon: $10 - $5 = $5. Total profit is $25, so number of gallons sold is $25 / $5 = 5 gallons. Then, cost for lemons is 5 gallons * $3 = $15. That seems right. \n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by calculating total revenue and total cost? Let's see. If they made a $25 profit, then total revenue minus total cost equals $25. Let me denote the number of gallons as x. \n\nTotal revenue would be x * $10 (since each gallon gives $10). Total cost is x * $5 (since each gallon costs $5). So profit is 10x - 5x = 5x. Set that equal to 25: 5x = 25 => x = 5. Then, the cost for lemons is 5 * $3 = $15.

Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many Chinese people there are in total. The total number of participants is 240, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the Chinese would be the remaining number. Let me calculate that: 240 minus 80 equals 160. So, there are 160 Chinese participants.\n\nNow, the question is about the Chinese team. It mentions that there are 60 boys in the Chinese team. But wait, does the problem specify that all the Chinese participants are in a team? Or is the team a subset of the Chinese participants? The wording says \"im chinesischen Team,\" which translates to \"in the Chinese team.\" So, maybe the entire Chinese group is considered as a team, and within that team, there are 60 boys. Therefore, the rest of the Chinese participants would be girls.\n\nBut hold on, the problem doesn't mention anything about girls in the Chinese team directly. It just gives the number of boys. So, if the total number of Chinese is 160, and 60 of them are boys, then the number of girls would be 160 minus 60. That would be 100. So, the answer should be 100 girls.\n\nWait, but is there any chance that the problem is referring to a different team?

So, unless there's more information, I think the straightforward approach is correct.\n\nLet me check again. Total participants: 240. Japanese: 80. Therefore, Chinese: 240 - 80 = 160. Chinese team has 60 boys. Assuming that the Chinese team consists of all Chinese participants, then girls would be 160 - 60 = 100. That seems right.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. For example, maybe the problem is in German, and \"im chinesischen Team\" could be interpreted differently? But I think the translation is accurate. The problem is straightforward: total Chinese is 160, boys are 60, so girls are 100. I don't see any other factors mentioned, like some Chinese people not being in the team or something. The problem states \"in einen Rennen mit 240 Asiaten waren 80 Japaner und der Rest waren Chinesen.\" So, the rest (160) are Chinese. Then, \"die Anzahl Jungen im chinesischen Team 60 betrug,\" so the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60.

Zaid earns $6000 a month. He has several expenses and donations. I need to figure out how much he has left after all of that. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he gives 1/4 of his salary for rent. So, 1/4 of 6000. Let me calculate that. 6000 divided by 4 is 1500. So rent is $1500.\n\nNext, he spends 1/3 of his salary on gasoline for his car. That would be 1/3 of 6000. Let me do that division. 6000 divided by 3 is 2000. So gasoline costs him $2000.\n\nNow, after paying rent and gas, he has some money left. Let me find out how much that is. Total salary is 6000. Subtract rent (1500) and gas (2000). So 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500. So he has $2500 remaining after rent and gas.\n\nThen, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Half of 2500 is 1250. So he donates $1250 to charity.\n\nAfter that, he gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses and his wife $700 for groceries and household items. So that's 200 + 700 = $900.\n\nNow, let's add up all his expenses and donations. Rent: 1500, gas: 2000, charity: 1250, daughter: 200, wife: 700. Let me sum those up.\n\n1500 + 2000 = 3500. Then 3500 + 1250 = 4750. Then 4750 + 200 = 4950. Then 4950 + 700 = 5650. So total expenses and donations are $5650.\n\nWait, but his total salary is $6000. So subtracting 5650 from 6000 gives 350. Hmm, but let me check again because maybe I made a mistake in the steps.\n\nWait, let me recheck each step. First, rent is 1/4 of 6000: 6000/4 = 1500. Correct. Gas is 1/3: 6000/3 = 2000. Correct. Then remaining after rent and gas: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500. Correct. Then he donates half of that, which is 1250. Then he gives 200 to daughter and 700 to wife. So total after donations and those gifts: 1250 + 200 + 700 = 2150. Then total expenses: 1500 + 2000 + 2150 = 5650. So 6000 - 5650 = 350. So he has $350 left. But let me check again because sometimes when you do step-by-step, you might have miscalculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should track the remaining amount after each step. Let's try that approach.\n\nStart with $6000.\n\nAfter rent: 6000 - 1500 = 4500.\n\nAfter gas: 4500 - 2000 = 2500.\n\nThen he donates half of the remaining, which is 2500 / 2 = 1250. So after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250.\n\nThen he gives 200 to daughter and 700 to wife. So total given to them is 200 + 700 = 900. So subtract that from 1250: 1250 - 900 = 350. So yes, same result. So he has $350 left.\n\nWait, but let me check if the donation is half of the remaining after rent and gas, which is 2500. So half is 1250. Then after that, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 left. Then he gives 200 + 700 = 900. So 1250 - 900 = 350. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe the problem is in the interpretation of the donation. The question says: \"spendet die Hälfte des verbleibenden Betrags an seine bevorzugte karitative Einrichtung.\" So \"spendet die Hälfte des verbleibenden Betrags\" – \"donates half of the remaining amount.\" So after rent and gas, the remaining is 2500. Then he donates half of that, so 1250. Then the remaining after donation is 1250. Then he gives 200 to daughter and 700 to wife. So total of 900. So 1250 - 900 = 350. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that after donating, he still has 1250, and then gives 200 and 700. So 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350. So that's the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $350. But let me check once again with another method.\n\nTotal salary: 6000.\n\nTotal spent on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500.\n\nTotal spent on gas: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000.\n\nTotal spent on charity: 1/2 * (6000 - 1500 - 2000) = 1/2 * 2500 = 1250.\n\nThen, 200 to daughter and 700 to wife: 900.\n\nTotal expenses: 1500 + 2000 + 1250 + 900 = 5650.\n\n6000 - 5650 = 350. Yep, same result.\n\nSo I think that's correct. Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all his expenses and donations.\n</think>\n\nZaid verdient 6000 $ pro Monat.

And Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Bo has 40 crabs. That's straightforward. Then Monic has 4 less than Bo. So, if Bo has 40, Monic would have 40 minus 4. Let me calculate that: 40 - 4 = 36. So Monic has 36 crabs.\n\nNow, Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Since Monic has 36, Rani would have 36 plus 10. Let me add that: 36 + 10 = 46. So Rani has 46 crabs.\n\nTo find the total number of crabs all three have together, I need to add up Bo's, Monic's, and Rani's crabs.

I need to figure out how old Jean is based on the information given. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says: \"Jean ist zwei Jahre älter als Mark.\" So, Jean is two years older than Mark. That means if I can find out Mark's age, I can just add two to get Jean's age. Got that part.\n\nNext part: \"Vor zwei Jahren war Mark 5 Jahre älter als die Hälfte des Alters von Jan.\" Translating that, two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age. And then it says, \"Wenn Jan 30 ist...\" So Jan is currently 30 years old. The question is, how old is Jean?\n\nAlright, let's structure this. Let me assign variables to each person's current age. Let's say:\n\n- Let J be Jean's current age.\n- Let M be Mark's current age.\n- Let Ja be Jan's current age.\n\nFrom the first statement: Jean is two years older than Mark. So, J = M + 2. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part: Two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age. Let's parse that. Two years ago, Mark's age would have been M - 2. At that time, Jan's age would have been Ja - 2. But the problem says that two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age. So, the equation here would be:\n\nM - 2 = (1/2)(Ja - 2) + 5\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure. The wording is \"Mark war 5 Jahre älter als die Hälfte des Alters von Jan.\" So, \"Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.\" So, that would be Mark's age = (half of Jan's age) + 5. So, yes, M - 2 = (1/2)(Ja - 2) + 5. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check the translation again. \"Vor zwei Jahren war Mark 5 Jahre älter als die Hälfte des Alters von Jan.\" So, two years ago, Mark's age was equal to (half of Jan's age at that time) plus 5. So, yes, that seems right. So, M - 2 = 5 + (1/2)(Ja - 2). Alternatively, M - 2 = (Ja - 2)/2 + 5.\n\nBut let me confirm. If someone is \"5 years older than X,\" that means their age is X + 5. So, if Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago, then Mark's age at that time is (half of Jan's age then) + 5. So, yes, that equation is correct.\n\nNow, we know that Jan is currently 30, so Ja = 30. Therefore, two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. So, substituting into the equation:\n\nM - 2 = (28)/2 + 5\n\nCalculating that: 28 divided by 2 is 14, plus 5 is 19. So, M - 2 = 19. Therefore, solving for M: M = 19 + 2 = 21. So, Mark is currently 21 years old.\n\nThen, since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23. Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the steps.\n\nFirst, Jan is 30 now. Two years ago, Jan was 28. Half of that is 14. Then, Mark was 5 years older than that, so 14 + 5 = 19. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 19, so now he is 19 + 2 = 21. Then Jean is 21 + 2 = 23. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if the equation was set up correctly. The problem says \"Vor zwei Jahren war Mark 5 Jahre älter als die Hälfte des Alters von Jan.\" So, two years ago, Mark's age = (half of Jan's age at that time) + 5. So, yes, that's exactly what I did. So, M - 2 = (Ja - 2)/2 + 5. Plugging in Ja = 30, we get M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19, so M = 21. Then Jean is 23. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another approach. Let's see.\n\nIf Jan is 30 now, two years ago she was 28. Half of that is 14. Mark was 5 years older than that, so 14 + 5 = 19. So, Mark was 19 two years ago, so now he is 21. Jean is two years older than Mark, so 21 + 2 = 23. Yep, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be 23.\n</think>\n\nJean ist zwei Jahre älter als Mark. Um Marks Alter zu bestimmen, betrachten wir die Information über Jan: Vor zwei Jahren war Mark 5 Jahre älter als die Hälfte des Alters von Jan. Da Jan heute 30 Jahre alt ist, war sie vor zwei Jahren 28 Jahre alt. Die Hälfte davon beträgt 14, und Mark war damals 5 Jahre älter als diese Hälfte, also $14 + 5 = 19$. Somit ist Mark heute $19 + 2 = 21$ Jahre alt. Jean, der zwei Jahre älter ist, ist daher $21 + 2 = 23$ Jahre alt.\n\n**Antwort:** Jean ist 23 Jahre alt."]], "filtered_resps": ["23"], "doc_hash": "de422d86e8592865f2adac823c7366fcce786a7c3f080eb8b8471c0949d3be6d", "prompt_hash": "1a8edd314162908d51be689ffc6aaffb49925cdaab3f76b888ed9fac5adbc72f", "target_hash": "535fa30d7e25dd8a49f1536779734ec8286108d115da5045d77f3b4185d8f790", "exact_match": 1.0}

There's a 4x400 meter relay race between two teams. I need to figure out by how many seconds the faster team will win. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, Team A is very balanced. Each of their four runners will run their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. So, the total time for Team A is straightforward: 4 runners * 55 seconds each. That would be 4 * 55 = 220 seconds. Got that.\n\nNow, Team B is less balanced. Their first runner takes 60 seconds. Then each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner is 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner is 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner is 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. Let me check that again. First runner: 60, second: 57, third: 54, fourth: 51. Yeah, that seems right. Each time subtracting 3 seconds.\n\nSo, adding up Team B's total time: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51. Let me calculate that. 60 + 57 is 117, then 54 + 51 is 105. So total is 117 + 105 = 222 seconds. Wait, that's 222 seconds for Team B.\n\nTeam A's total time is 220 seconds. So, Team A is faster by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds. Therefore, Team A would win by 2 seconds. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my math to be sure.\n\nFor Team B: 60, 57, 54, 51. Let's add them one by one. 60 + 57 = 117. Then 117 + 54 = 171. Then 171 + 51 = 222. Yes, that's correct. Team A: 55 * 4 = 220. So difference is 2 seconds. So the answer should be 2 seconds.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again. The question says \"Um wie viele Sekunden wird das schnellere Team ausgehend von diesen Informationen gewinnen?\" So, \"By how many seconds will the faster team win?\" So, if Team A is faster, then they win by 2 seconds. That seems right.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, in relay races, sometimes the baton exchange can affect the time, but the problem doesn't mention anything about that. It just says each runner runs 400 meters, so I think we can assume that the total time is just the sum of each runner's individual times. So, no need to consider baton exchanges or anything else here.\n\nAnother thing: the problem says \"Standard-Strecke\" which is a standard track, so 400 meters per lap. But since each runner runs 400 meters, that's one lap each. So, no issues there. The times given are for each runner's 400 meters, so adding them up is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. Team A's total time is 220 seconds, Team B's is 222 seconds. The difference is 2 seconds. So, the faster team (Team A) will win by 2 seconds.\n</think>\n\nDas schnellere Team (Team A) gewinnt das Rennen um **2 Sekunden**.\n\n**Berechnung:**\n\n- **Team A:** Jeder Läufer benötigt 55 Sekunden.  \n  Gesamtzeit: $4 \\times 55 = 220$ Sekunden.\n\n- **Team B:**  \n  - 1.

The question is asking: Jerry rolls a six-sided die. How much more likely (in percentage terms) is it that he rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row? Hmm, okay. So I need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and then compare it to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then express the difference as a percentage. Wait, actually, the wording is a bit confusing. It says \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... dass er eine Zahl größer als 3 wirft als zwei gerade Zahlen hintereinander?\" So, in English, that would be \"How much more likely is it that he rolls a number greater than 3 than rolling two even numbers in a row?\" So, I think it's asking for the difference in probabilities between the two events, expressed as a percentage. But I need to be careful here.\n\nFirst, let's break down the two events:\n\n1. Rolling a number greater than 3 on a single die roll.\n2. Rolling two even numbers in a row (i.e., two consecutive rolls, both even).\n\nWait, but the question says \"zwei gerade Zahlen hintereinander\" which translates to \"two even numbers in a row.\" So, that would be two separate rolls, right? So, the first event is a single roll, the second is two rolls. But the question is comparing the probability of the first event to the probability of the second event. So, the question is: What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 (let's call this P(A)) compared to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row (P(B)), and how much more likely is P(A) than P(B) in percentage terms?\n\nSo, first, let's compute P(A). A six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6. Numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, 6. So that's 3 outcomes. Therefore, P(A) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nNow, P(B) is the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Assuming that each roll is independent, the probability of getting an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2, since the even numbers are 2, 4, 6. Therefore, the probability of getting two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nNow, the question is asking how much more likely is P(A) than P(B). So, the difference in probabilities is P(A) - P(B) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. But the question says \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... in Prozent ausgedrückt.\" So, how much more likely in percentage terms. Hmm. So, is it asking for the absolute difference in percentage points, or the relative difference as a percentage?\n\nWait, if it's asking \"how much more likely,\" that could be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1. The absolute difference: P(A) - P(B) = 25% (since 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25, which is 25 percentage points).\n\n2. The relative difference: (P(A) - P(B)) / P(B) * 100% = (0.25 / 0.25) * 100% = 100%. So, P(A) is 100% more likely than P(B).\n\nBut the question is in German, and the phrasing is \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... als...\" which is a bit ambiguous. However, in probability questions, when they ask \"how much more likely,\" it's often the relative difference. But I need to check the exact wording again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es (in Prozent ausgedrückt), dass er eine Zahl größer als 3 wirft als zwei gerade Zahlen hintereinander?\"\n\nTranslating: \"How much more likely (expressed in percentage) is it that he rolls a number greater than 3 than rolling two even numbers in a row?\"\n\nSo, the structure is \"how much more likely is A than B,\" which in probability terms is usually the relative difference. For example, if A is twice as likely as B, then it's 100% more likely. But sometimes, people might interpret it as the absolute difference. However, given that the answer is expected in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25 percentage points, but the relative difference is 100%, which is a more significant percentage.\n\nBut let's think about the possible answers. If the answer is 25%, that would be the absolute difference. If it's 100%, that's the relative difference. Which one is correct?\n\nIn probability, when someone says \"how much more likely,\" it's often the relative difference. For example, if event A has a 50% chance and event B has a 25% chance, then A is twice as likely as B, which is a 100% increase in probability. However, in some contexts, people might just say the difference in percentages. But given that the question is from a math problem, it's more likely to be the relative difference.\n\nBut let's check with an example. Suppose P(A) is 50% and P(B) is 25%. The question is \"how much more likely is A than B?\" If you say \"25 percentage points more likely,\" that's correct. If you say \"100% more likely,\" that's also correct in terms of relative increase. However, in some contexts, \"how much more likely\" can be ambiguous. But since the answer is to be given in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25%, which is a percentage point difference, whereas the relative difference is 100%, which is a percentage increase.\n\nBut in German, the phrasing might be more precise. Let me think. The question is \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... als...\" which is \"how much more likely is it... than...\" In German, this is often interpreted as the relative difference. For example, if something is twice as likely, you say \"es ist doppelt so wahrscheinlich.\" But if you say \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher,\" it's more like \"how much more likely in terms of percentage,\" which could be the relative difference.\n\nBut to be safe, let's check both possibilities.\n\nIf the answer is 25%, that's the absolute difference. If it's 100%, that's the relative difference. However, in the context of the problem, since both probabilities are given as percentages (50% and 25%), the absolute difference is 25 percentage points. However, the question says \"in Prozent ausgedrückt,\" which is \"expressed in percentage.\" If they wanted the absolute difference, they might have said \"in Prozentpunkten\" (percentage points). But since they said \"in Prozent,\" it's more likely they want the relative difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of the two probabilities, expressed as a percentage. For example, P(A)/P(B) = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2, which is 200%, so A is 200% as likely as B, which would mean 100% more likely. But that's the same as the relative difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"how much more likely is A than B,\" which is (P(A) - P(B))/P(B) * 100% = 100%.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think of another example. If P(A) is 30% and P(B) is 10%, then \"how much more likely is A than B?\" The absolute difference is 20 percentage points, the relative difference is 200% (since 30 is 200% more than 10). So, in that case, the answer would be 200% more likely.\n\nTherefore, in our case, since P(A) is 50% and P(B) is 25%, the relative difference is (50 - 25)/25 * 100% = 100%. So, the answer would be 100%.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the question is indeed asking for the relative difference. However, in some contexts, people might just take the absolute difference. But given that the answer is to be in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25%, which is a percentage point difference, but the relative difference is 100%, which is a percentage increase.\n\nBut in German, the term \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher\" could be interpreted as \"by what percentage is A more likely than B,\" which would be the relative difference. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But given that the answer is expected in percentage, and the absolute difference is 25%, which is a percentage point, but the relative difference is 100%, which is a percentage increase.\n\nWait, but the question says \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... in Prozent ausgedrückt,\" which is \"how much more likely is it... expressed in percentage.\" So, if you take \"wie viel\" as \"how much,\" then it's the absolute difference in percentage terms. But percentage points are different from percentages. For example, if something increases from 25% to 50%, that's an increase of 25 percentage points, or 100% in relative terms.\n\nBut the question is in German, and in German, \"in Prozent\" would typically refer to the relative difference, not the absolute. However, I'm not 100% sure. Let me check with an example. If someone says \"Wie viel Prozent mehr ist 50 als 25?\" the answer would be 100%, because 50 is 100% more than 25. So, in that case, it's the relative difference. Therefore, if the question is \"wie viel wahrscheinlicher ist es... in Prozent,\" it's likely referring to the relative difference, which is 100%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 100%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check both interpretations.\n\nIf the question is asking for the absolute difference in percentage points, then it's 50% - 25% = 25 percentage points. But the question says \"in Prozent ausgedrückt,\" which would be 25% if they mean percentage points, but that's not standard. Usually, percentage points are specified as \"Prozentpunkte.\" So, if they just say \"in Prozent,\" it's more likely the relative difference.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 100%.\n\nBut let me verify once more. Suppose the probability of A is 50%, and the probability of B is 25%. The question is \"how much more likely is A than B?\" If you say \"A is 100% more likely than B,\" that means A is twice as likely as B. Which is correct because 50% is twice 25%. So, the relative increase is 100%.\n\nAlternatively, if you say \"A is 25% more likely than B,\" that would mean A is 25% more than B, which would be 25% + 25% of 25% = 31.25%, which is not the case here. Therefore, the correct relative increase is 100%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 100%.\n\nBut to make sure, let's check the exact calculation:\n\nRelative difference = (P(A) - P(B)) / P(B) * 100% = (0.5 - 0.25) / 0.25 * 100% = 0.25 / 0.25 * 100% = 1 * 100% = 100%.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the answer is 100%.\n\nBut wait, the original question is in German, and sometimes in German, the phrasing might be different. However, based on standard probability terminology, this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 100%.\n</think>\n\nJerry wirft einen sechsseitigen Würfel.

So, Russell is distributing straw to different animals in the pet store. The question is asking how many rats are in each cage. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, there are three cages for rats, and they're kept in equal-sized groups. Each rat gets 6 straws. Then there are 10 hamster cages, each hamster is alone, so each hamster gets 5 straws. There's also a rabbit hutch where 20 straws are given out. The total number of straws given to the small rodents is 160. We need to find out how many rats are in each cage.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"kleine Nagetiere\" which translates to small rodents. So, that would include the rats and the hamsters, right? The rabbits are probably not considered rodents here, so the 20 straws for the rabbits are separate. So the total straws given to the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. The rabbits are in their own hutch with 20 straws, which isn't part of the 160.\n\nSo, let's structure this:\n\nTotal straws for small rodents (rats and hamsters) = 160.\n\nRats are in 3 cages, each cage has the same number of rats. Let's call the number of rats per cage \"x\". Therefore, total rats = 3x. Each rat gets 6 straws, so total straws for rats = 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nHamsters: 10 cages, each with 1 hamster. So total hamsters = 10. Each hamster gets 5 straws, so total straws for hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nSo total straws for rats and hamsters is 18x + 50 = 160.\n\nTherefore, solving for x:\n\n18x + 50 = 160\n\nSubtract 50 from both sides:\n\n18x = 110\n\nThen x = 110 / 18\n\nWait, that gives a decimal. Hmm, 110 divided by 18 is approximately 6.111... But the number of rats should be a whole number. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nLet me check the problem again. The question says \"die Ratten werden in 3 Käfigen in gleich großen Gruppen gehalten\" which means the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal-sized groups. So each cage has the same number of rats. So total rats is 3 times the number per cage. Each rat gets 6 straws. Hamsters are 10 cages, each with 1 hamster, so 10 hamsters. Each hamster gets 5 straws. The total straws for small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. The rabbits have 20 straws, which are separate.\n\nSo the equation is 18x + 50 = 160. Then 18x = 110. Hmm, 110 divided by 18 is 6.111... That's not a whole number. That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says \"unter den Nagetieren\" which are the rodents, so the rabbits are not rodents. So the 160 straws are only for the rats and hamsters. The rabbits are separate. So the calculation should be correct. But getting a fractional number of rats doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a miscalculation.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nTotal straws for rats: 3 cages, each with x rats, so 3x rats. Each rat gets 6 straws: 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nTotal straws for hamsters: 10 hamsters, each gets 5 straws: 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nTotal straws for rodents: 18x + 50 = 160.\n\nSo 18x = 160 - 50 = 110.\n\nx = 110 / 18 = 5.555... Wait, that's still not a whole number. That's strange. Maybe the problem has a typo, or I misread something.\n\nWait, the problem says \"die Ratten werden in 3 Käfigen in gleich großen Gruppen gehalten\" – so the rats are in 3 cages, each with the same number of rats. So total rats is 3 times the number per cage. But maybe the problem is in German, and \"gleich großen Gruppen\" could mean that each group is the same size, but maybe the total number of rats is divided into 3 groups, each group being a cage. So that's the same as 3x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the total straws given to the small rodents is 160, which includes the rabbits? Wait, the problem says \"überall sonst im Laden wird kein Stroh verteilt\" – so only the rats, hamsters, and rabbits get straws. But the question says \"160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteilt wurden\" – so the 160 is only for the small rodents, which are rats and hamsters. The rabbits are in their own hutch with 20 straws, which are not part of the 160. So the equation should be correct.\n\nBut 110 divided by 18 is not a whole number. That suggests that either the problem has an error, or I have a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. The problem says:\n\n- Rats in 3 cages, equal groups. Each rat gets 6 straws.\n\n- 10 hamster cages, each with 1 hamster. Each hamster gets 5 straws.\n\n- 1 rabbit hutch with 20 straws.\n\nTotal straws for small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160.\n\nSo, total straws for rats: 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\nTotal straws for hamsters: 10 * 5 = 50.\n\nTotal: 18x + 50 = 160.\n\nSo 18x = 110.\n\nx = 110 / 18 ≈ 6.111...\n\nHmm. That's not possible. Maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to all animals (including rabbits) is 160? Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe original question says: \"Wenn 160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteilt wurden, wie viele Ratten sind dann in jedem Käfig?\"\n\nSo \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\" – which would be among the small rodents. So that would be rats and hamsters. The rabbits are not rodents, so their 20 straws are separate. Therefore, the 160 is only for rats and hamsters. So the equation is correct.\n\nBut the answer is not a whole number. That's a problem. Maybe the problem has a typo. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated 160 - 50. 160 - 50 is 110. Yes. 18x = 110. So x = 110/18 = 5.555... That's not possible. Maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to all animals (including rabbits) is 160? Let's try that.\n\nIf total straws including rabbits is 160, then:\n\nStraws for rats: 18x\n\nStraws for hamsters: 50\n\nStraws for rabbits: 20\n\nTotal: 18x + 50 + 20 = 18x + 70 = 160\n\nThen 18x = 90\n\nx = 5\n\nThat would make sense. So maybe the problem had a translation error, and the 160 includes the rabbits. But the original question says \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\", which are the small rodents, so rabbits are not included. But if that's the case, then the answer is not a whole number, which is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that the total straws given to all animals is 160, and the rabbits are part of that. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Wenn 160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteilt wurden, wie viele Ratten sind dann in jedem Käfig?\"\n\nSo \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\" – among the small rodents. So rabbits are not included. Therefore, the 160 is only for rats and hamsters. So the equation is 18x + 50 = 160, leading to x = 110/18 ≈ 6.11. That's not possible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem or in my interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the total straws given to all animals (including rabbits) is 160. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Es gibt auch einen Hasenstall, in dem 20 Strohhalme unter den Hasen verteilt werden. Überall sonst in dem Laden wird kein Stroh verteilt. Wenn 160 Strohhalme unter den kleinen Nagetieren verteilt wurden...\"\n\nSo the 20 straws for the rabbits are separate. The 160 is for the small rodents (rats and hamsters). So the equation is correct. But the answer is not a whole number. That's a problem. Maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to all animals is 160, including the rabbits. Let's try that.\n\nTotal straws: 18x (rats) + 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 18x + 70 = 160\n\nThen 18x = 90 => x = 5. That would make sense. So maybe the original problem had a translation error, and the 160 includes the rabbits. But according to the German text, it's \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\", which are the small rodents, so rabbits are not included. Therefore, the problem might have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I misread the number of straws given to the hamsters or rats.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"jeder Ratte 6 Strohhalme gegeben. Es gibt 10 Käfige von Hamstern, die allein gehalten werden, und jedem Hamster werden 5 Strohhalme gegeben.\"\n\nSo that's correct. Each rat gets 6, each hamster gets 5. So the numbers are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that the total straws given to the small rodents is 160, which includes the rabbits. But that would be incorrect because rabbits are not rodents. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. Maybe \"unter den Nagetieren\" includes the rabbits? But in German, \"Nagetiere\" are rodents, and rabbits are \"Kaninchen\", which are not rodents. So that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to all animals is 160, and the 20 straws for the rabbits are part of that. Let's try that.\n\nTotal straws: 18x (rats) + 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 18x + 70 = 160\n\nThen 18x = 90 => x = 5. That would make sense. So maybe the original problem had a translation error, and the 160 includes the rabbits. But according to the given text, it's \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\", which are the small rodents, so rabbits are not included. Therefore, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that the total straws given to the small rodents is 160, which includes the rabbits. But that would be incorrect. However, if we proceed with that, we get a whole number. Maybe the problem intended that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo in the number of straws. For example, if the total straws for small rodents is 160, and the hamsters are 10 with 5 each, that's 50. Then 160 - 50 = 110 for the rats. 110 divided by 6 is about 18.333 rats total, which would be 6.111 per cage. Still not a whole number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that each rat gets 5 straws instead of 6? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"jeder Ratte 6 Strohhalme gegeben.\" So that's 6 per rat. Hamsters get 5 each. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. This is perplexing. Maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 5.555... but that's not possible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's numbers. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. Let's assume that the total straws given to the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. So:\n\nTotal straws for rats: 6 * number of rats\n\nTotal straws for hamsters: 5 * 10 = 50\n\nSo 6 * number of rats + 50 = 160\n\nTherefore, 6 * number of rats = 110\n\nNumber of rats = 110 / 6 ≈ 18.333\n\nBut the number of rats must be a whole number. So this suggests that the problem has an inconsistency. Unless the number of straws per rat is different.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that each rat gets 5 straws, and each hamster gets 6? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal: \"jeder Ratte 6 Strohhalme gegeben. Es gibt 10 Käfige von Hamstern, die allein gehalten werden, und jedem Hamster werden 5 Strohhalme gegeben.\"\n\nNo, it's 6 for rats, 5 for hamsters. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of hamsters is different. The problem says 10 cages of hamsters, each alone. So 10 hamsters. That's correct.\n\nHmm. This is really confusing. Maybe the problem is from a source that has a typo. If we assume that the total straws for small rodents is 160, and the answer is 5 rats per cage, then:\n\nNumber of rats = 3 * 5 = 15\n\nStraws for rats: 15 * 6 = 90\n\nStraws for hamsters: 10 * 5 = 50\n\nTotal: 90 + 50 = 140, which is not 160. So that's not matching.\n\nIf the answer is 6 rats per cage:\n\nNumber of rats = 3 * 6 = 18\n\nStraws for rats: 18 * 6 = 108\n\nStraws for hamsters: 50\n\nTotal: 108 + 50 = 158, which is still not 160.\n\nIf 7 rats per cage:\n\n3 * 7 = 21\n\n21 * 6 = 126\n\n126 + 50 = 176, which is over 160.\n\nSo there's no whole number of rats per cage that would make the total straws for small rodents 160. Therefore, the problem must have an error. However, since the user is asking for an answer, maybe I should proceed with the calculation even though it's not a whole number, or check if there's another interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the total straws given to all animals is 160, including the rabbits. Let's try that:\n\nTotal straws: 18x (rats) + 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 18x + 70 = 160\n\n18x = 90 => x = 5. That works. So maybe the original problem had a translation error, and the 160 includes the rabbits. If that's the case, then the answer is 5 rats per cage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the total straws given to the small rodents is 160, and the rabbits are part of that. But that would be incorrect. However, if we proceed with that, then:\n\nTotal straws for small rodents (including rabbits): 160\n\nStraws for hamsters: 50\n\nStraws for rabbits: 20\n\nSo straws for rats: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90\n\nNumber of rats: 90 / 6 = 15\n\nNumber of rats per cage: 15 / 3 = 5\n\nThat would make sense. So maybe the problem had a translation error, and \"unter den kleinen Nagetieren\" actually includes the rabbits, even though they are not rodents. That might be a possible mistake in the problem.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be 5 rats per cage. Since this is the only way to get a whole number, I think this is the intended solution, despite the possible translation error.\n</think>\n\nUm die Anzahl der Ratten pro Käfig zu bestimmen, analysieren wir die gegebenen Informationen:\n\n1. **Ratten**:  \n   - Es gibt **3 Käfige** mit gleich vielen Ratten.  \n   - Jede Ratte erhält **6 Strohhalme**.  \n   - Sei $ x $ die Anzahl der Ratten pro Käfig.  \n   - Gesamtzahl der Ratten: $ 3x $.  \n   - Gesamtstrohhalme für Ratten: $ 3x \\cdot 6 = 18x $.\n\n2. **Hamster**:  \n   - Es gibt **10 Käfige**, jeweils **1 Hamster** pro Käfig.  \n   - Jeder Hamster erhält **5 Strohhalme**.  \n   - Gesamtstrohhalme für Hamster: $ 10 \\cdot 5 = 50 $.\n\n3. **Hasen**:  \n   - **20 Strohhalme** werden an die Hasen verteilt.  \n   - Diese werden **nicht** in die Gesamtzahl der 160 Strohhalme für Nagetiere einbezogen.\n\n4. **Gesamtstrohhalme für Nagetiere (Ratten und Hamster)**:  \n   - $ 18x + 50 = 160 $.\n\n**Lösung der Gleichung**:  \n$$\n18x + 50 = 160 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 18x = 110 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{110}{18} \\approx 6.11\n$$\n\nDa die Anzahl der Ratten pro Käfig eine ganze Zahl sein muss, deutet dies auf einen Fehler in der Aufgabenstellung hin. **Wenn wir annehmen**, dass die **160 Strohhalme** auch die **Hasen** (20 Strohhalme) einschließen, ergibt sich:\n\n$$\n18x + 50 + 20 = 160 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 18x = 90 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 5\n$$\n\n**Antwort**:  \n$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$\n\n**Erklärung**:  \nDie korrekte Interpretation der Aufgabenstellung führt zu einer ganzen Zahl, wenn die 160 Strohhalme **alle Tiere** (Ratten, Hamster und Hasen) umfassen.

Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed on a monthly interest rate of 2%. She pays after 3 months. I need to figure out how much she has to pay in total. Hmm, so this is about compound interest or simple interest? The question doesn't specify, but usually, when it's just monthly interest without mentioning compounding, it might be simple interest. But sometimes, in some contexts, it could be compounded. Wait, the problem says \"monatliche Zinsen in Höhe von 2%\", which translates to monthly interest of 2%. So maybe it's simple interest? Or is it compounded monthly?\n\nWait, in German, \"Zinsen\" can be either simple or compound, but if it's just stated as a monthly interest rate without specifying compounding, it might be simple interest. But I need to check. Let me think. If it's simple interest, the total interest would be principal * rate * time. So 100 * 0.02 * 3 = $6. So total amount would be 100 + 6 = $106. But if it's compound interest, then each month the interest is added to the principal. So first month: 100 * 1.02 = 102. Second month: 102 * 1.02 = 104.04. Third month: 104.04 * 1.02 = 106.1208. So approximately $106.12. But the question is in German, and maybe in the context of the problem, they expect simple interest? Or compound?\n\nWait, the problem says \"monatliche Zinsen in Höhe von 2%\", which is \"monthly interest of 2%\". In some cases, if it's simple interest, the total interest would be 2% per month times the number of months. But if it's compound interest, it's 2% per month compounded monthly. However, in many cases, when you have a loan with monthly interest, it's often compounded. But maybe in this case, since it's just stated as monthly interest, it's simple interest. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the exact wording again. \"Sie einigten sich darauf, monatliche Zinsen in Höhe von 2 % zu haben.\" So they agreed on monthly interest of 2%. The term \"Zinsen\" here could be either. But in German financial contexts, if it's not specified, it might be simple interest. However, in practice, loans usually compound interest. But without more information, it's ambiguous. However, since the problem is likely from a math textbook or something, maybe it's expecting simple interest. But I need to check both possibilities.\n\nIf it's simple interest: 100 * 0.02 * 3 = 6, total 106.\n\nIf it's compound interest: 100*(1.02)^3 ≈ 106.12.\n\nBut the answer might depend on the convention. In some countries, for example, in Germany, if it's a loan with monthly interest, it's often compounded. But I'm not sure. However, since the problem doesn't specify compounding, maybe it's simple interest. But I need to think about standard problems. In many basic math problems, unless stated otherwise, simple interest is used. However, sometimes, if it's about loans, compound interest is more common. Hmm.\n\nWait, the question is in German, and maybe in the German education system, they might teach that if it's monthly interest, it's compounded. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a chapter that deals with simple interest, so the answer is 106. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given that the time is 3 months, and the interest is monthly, it's possible that it's compounded each month. So the answer would be 100*(1.02)^3.\n\nCalculating that: 1.02^3 = 1.061208, so 100*1.061208 = 106.1208, which is approximately $106.12. But maybe they want it rounded to the nearest cent, so $106.12. However, if it's simple interest, it's exactly $106. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, the problem says \"monatliche Zinsen in Höhe von 2 %\". The term \"Zinsen\" can be either simple or compound. But in German, if it's compound interest, it's usually specified as \"Zinseszins\" (compound interest). Since it's just \"Zinsen\", it might be simple interest. Therefore, the answer would be $106. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a context where compound interest is assumed. For example, in many real-world scenarios, interest is compounded unless stated otherwise. But again, without knowing the exact context, it's tricky. However, given that the problem is likely a math problem, and in many math problems, unless specified, simple interest is used. Therefore, the answer is $106. But I'm not 100% sure. However, since the user is asking for the answer, and given that in some cases, even with monthly interest, it's simple, but in others, it's compound. Maybe I should present both possibilities and explain.\n\nBut the original answer given by the assistant was 106.12, which is compound. Wait, but the user is asking for the answer, and the assistant's previous answer was 106.12. But maybe the correct answer is 106.12. Let me check with the formula for compound interest. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Here, P = 100, r = 2% per month, n = 1 (compounded monthly), t = 3 months. So A = 100*(1 + 0.02)^3 = 100*(1.02)^3 ≈ 106.12. So that's compound interest. But if it's simple interest, it's 100 + 100*0.02*3 = 106. So which is it?\n\nIn the absence of specific information, but given that the interest is monthly and the time is 3 months, it's more likely that the interest is compounded each month. Therefore, the answer is approximately $106.12. However, in some educational contexts, they might use simple interest. But since the problem mentions \"monatliche Zinsen\" (monthly interest), which could imply that each month's interest is calculated on the original principal, which would be simple interest. Wait, no, if it's monthly interest, and they are paying after 3 months, it's possible that each month's interest is added to the principal, hence compounding. But again, without explicit mention of compounding, it's ambiguous.\n\nBut in many cases, when you have a loan with a monthly interest rate, it's compounded. For example, credit cards use monthly compounding. So maybe the answer is 106.12. However, the problem might be from a simple interest chapter.

I need to figure out how many sacks of wheat the trader sold. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the trader buys some sacks from a farmer at $20 per sack. Then, there's a transportation cost of $2 per sack to move them from the farm to the warehouse. After that, the trader sells all the sacks at $30 each and makes a total profit of $400. The question is asking how many sacks he sold.\n\nHmm, profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. So, I need to find the total revenue and total costs, set up the equation, and solve for the number of sacks.\n\nLet me denote the number of sacks as 'x'. \n\nTotal revenue would be the selling price per sack times the number of sacks. That's 30 dollars per sack times x, so 30x.\n\nNow, total costs. The trader has two types of costs: the cost of buying the sacks and the transportation cost. \n\nThe cost of buying the sacks is $20 per sack, so that's 20x. Then, transportation is $2 per sack, so that's another 2x. Therefore, total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.\n\nProfit is total revenue minus total cost. According to the problem, the profit is $400. So:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n400 = 30x - 22x\n\nSimplifying the right side: 30x - 22x is 8x. So:\n\n400 = 8x\n\nTo find x, divide both sides by 8:\n\nx = 400 / 8\nx = 50\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if I considered all costs correctly. The problem says the trader buys the sacks at $20 each, transports them at $2 each, and sells them at $30 each. So yes, the total cost per sack is 20 + 2 = $22, and selling at $30 gives a profit of $8 per sack. Then total profit is 8x = 400, so x = 50. That seems right.\n\nBut let me verify with actual numbers. If he sold 50 sacks:\n\nRevenue: 50 * 30 = $1500\n\nCosts: 50 * 20 (purchase) + 50 * 2 (transport) = 1000 + 100 = $1100\n\nProfit: 1500 - 1100 = $400. Yep, that matches the given profit. So the answer is 50 sacks.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any other costs mentioned, so this should be the right approach.\n</think>\n\nDer Händler kaufte $ x $ Säcke Weizen zu 20 $ pro Sack und zahlte 2 $ pro Sack für den Transport.

Three friends went to the fair and spent some money. I need to figure out how much each of them paid if they split the costs equally. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says they paid $20.25 for 3 tickets. So, that's straightforward. The total cost for the tickets is $20.25. Then, they spent $4.50 less on food than they did on the tickets. So, the food cost would be the ticket cost minus $4.50. Let me write that down:\n\nTickets: $20.25\nFood: $20.25 - $4.50 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that. 20.25 minus 4.50. Hmm, 20.25 minus 4 is 16.25, and then minus another 0.50 is 15.75. So, the food cost is $15.75.\n\nNext, they took two different trains, each ride costing $33. Wait, the wording says \"2 verschiedene Bahnen, bei denen jede Fahrt 33 $ kostet.\" So, \"2 different trains, each ride costing 33 dollars.\" So, does that mean they took two rides, each costing $33? Or is it two different trains, each with a ride cost of $33? I think it's two rides, each costing $33. So total train cost is 2 * $33 = $66.\n\nSo, total costs are tickets + food + trains. Let me add those up.\n\nTickets: $20.25\nFood: $15.75\nTrains: $66.00\n\nTotal cost = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66.00. Let me compute that. 20.25 + 15.75 is 36.00, right? Because 20 + 15 is 35, and 0.25 + 0.75 is 1.00, so total 36.00. Then adding 66.00 gives 36 + 66 = 102.00. So total cost is $102.00.\n\nNow, they split the costs equally among three friends. So each person pays 102 divided by 3. Let me do that division. 102 ÷ 3 = 34. So each person pays $34.00.\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each part:\n\nTickets: 3 tickets for $20.25. That seems okay. Then food is $4.50 less than tickets, so 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75. Correct. Trains: 2 rides at $33 each, so 2*33=66. Correct. Total: 20.25 + 15.75 = 36, plus 66 is 102. Divided by 3 is 34. Yes, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"3 Eintritte\" which is 3 tickets, so that's correct. The food is 4.50 less than the tickets, so that's 15.75. Trains: 2 different trains, each ride 33. So two rides, each 33. So 66. Total 102. Divided by 3 is 34. So each pays 34 dollars. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just check once more. Maybe I miscalculated the food cost? 20.25 minus 4.50. Let's do it another way: 20.25 - 4.50. If I subtract 4.50 from 20.25, I can think of it as 20.25 - 4.00 = 16.25, then subtract 0.50 more: 16.25 - 0.50 = 15.75. Yes, that's correct. So food is 15.75. Then total is 20.25 + 15.75 = 36, plus 66 is 102. Divided by 3 is 34. Yep, that's right.

Tom plants 10 trees each year, but 2 trees fall down every year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. I need to find out how many trees he has left after all that. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial number of trees is 50. Each year, he plants 10 and loses 2. So, the net gain per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees. But wait, does that mean each year the total number of trees increases by 8? Let me check that. If he starts with 50, then after one year, he adds 10 and subtracts 2, so 50 + 10 - 2 = 58. Then the next year, it would be 58 + 10 - 2 = 66, and so on. So yes, each year the number of trees increases by 8. So over 10 years, the total number of trees would be 50 + 8*10 = 50 + 80 = 130? Wait, but that seems too straightforward. But maybe I need to consider that the 30% die after 10 years. So first, calculate the number of trees after 10 years of planting and losing, then apply the 30% death rate.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Nach 10 Jahren sterben 30 % der Bäume.\" So after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So first, calculate the number of trees after 10 years of planting and losing, then subtract 30% of that number.\n\nSo let's confirm the number of trees after 10 years. Starting with 50, each year adding 8. So after 1 year: 50 + 8 = 58. After 2 years: 58 + 8 = 66. Continuing this way, after 10 years, it would be 50 + 8*10 = 50 + 80 = 130. So 130 trees after 10 years. Then, 30% of these die. So 30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39. Therefore, the remaining trees would be 130 - 39 = 91. So the answer is 91?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the net gain is 8 per year. Let me check again. Each year, he plants 10 and loses 2. So the net change is +8 per year. So over 10 years, that's 10*8 = 80 added to the initial 50, giving 130. Then 30% die, so 70% remain. 130 * 0.7 = 91. That seems right.\n\nBut another way to think about it: Maybe the 30% death happens after the 10 years, so the 30% is applied to the total number of trees after 10 years. So yes, same as before. So 130 trees, 30% die, 70% left. 130 * 0.7 = 91. So the answer is 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the 30% is applied to the total after 10 years, not each year. The problem says \"Nach 10 Jahren sterben 30 % der Bäume.\" So after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So that's a one-time event after the 10 years. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the 30% death was happening each year, the calculation would be different, but the problem states it's after 10 years. So I think the answer is 91. Let me just verify once more.\n\nStart with 50. Each year, +10 -2 = +8. After 10 years: 50 + 10*8 = 130. Then 30% die: 130 * 0.7 = 91. Yes, that seems correct.

The question is asking how many more pink than white there are. So subtract the number of white from pink: 30 - 6 = 24. \n\nWait, let me check again. Friday: 18 pink. Saturday: take away 6 pink, paint them white, so 12 pink and 6 white. Then Sunday: add 18 pink, so 12 + 18 = 30 pink. White remains 6. So difference is 30 - 6 = 24. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I missed anything. The key steps are calculating the third on Saturday and then adding the 18 on Sunday. The white ones are only the 6 that were repainted. So the answer should be 24.\n</think>\n\nAm Freitagmorgen gibt es **18 rosa Flamingos**.  \nAm Samstagmorgen werden **1/3 der Flamingos** (also 6 Stück) entfernt, gestrichen und als **weiße Flamingos** zurückgestellt.  \n- **Rosa Flamingos nach Samstag**: $18 - 6 = 12$  \n- **Weiße Flamingos nach Samstag**: $6$  \n\nAm Sonntagmorgen werden **18 weitere rosa Flamingos** hinzugefügt:  \n- **Rosa Flamingos am Sonntag**: $12 + 18 = 30$  \n- **Weiße Flamingos bleiben unverändert**: $6$  \n\n**Differenz**: $30 - 6 = 24$  \n\n**Antwort:** Es waren **24 rosa Flamingos** mehr als weiße Flamingos am Sonntagnachmittag.  \n$\\boxed{24}$"]], "filtered_resps": ["24"], "doc_hash": "2812c179004f1a720dd8129306cab5f31bdcc2b3c53d9ae4b5507cc18d617cc4", "prompt_hash": "9285bc5290e605d370d9ff65d06a54a0ed0ed3ae84b19a02772fd0e728786e6c", "target_hash": "c2356069e9d1e79ca924378153cfbbfb4d4416b1f99d41a2940bfdb66c5319db", "exact_match": 1.0}

Violetta wants to buy new crayons. She needs them in 5 different colors. She has $20 set aside for this purchase. Each crayon costs $2. The question is, how much change will she get?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many crayons she is buying. The problem says she needs them in 5 different colors. Wait, does that mean she wants one of each color, or multiple crayons of each color? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"Sie braucht sie in 5 verschiedenen Farben.\" Translating that, it's \"She needs them in 5 different colors.\" So maybe she needs one crayon of each color, making it 5 crayons total. But sometimes, when people say they need something in different colors, they might mean multiple of each. But since the problem doesn't specify the quantity per color, I think the safest assumption is that she needs one crayon of each color, so 5 crayons in total.\n\nIf each crayon costs $2, then the total cost would be 5 crayons multiplied by $2 each. Let me calculate that: 5 * 2 = $10. So she spends $10. She had $20, so the change would be $20 - $10 = $10. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. What if she needs multiple crayons of each color? For example, if she needs 5 crayons in total, but maybe she wants 5 of each color? But the problem doesn't say that. The original question is in German, and the translation is \"Sie braucht sie in 5 verschiedenen Farben.\" The word \"sie\" here refers to the crayons. So she needs the crayons in 5 different colors. That could mean that she needs 5 crayons, each of a different color. So one of each color. Therefore, 5 crayons total.\n\nAlternatively, if she needs multiple crayons of each color, the problem should specify. For example, \"5 crayons in each of 5 different colors\" would be 25 crayons. But since it's not stated, I think the correct interpretation is 5 crayons, one of each color.\n\nSo total cost is 5 * $2 = $10. She pays with $20, so change is $20 - $10 = $10. Therefore, the answer should be $10.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe the problem is in German, and sometimes the translation might have nuances. Let me check the original German sentence again: \"Sie braucht sie in 5 verschiedenen Farben.\" \"Braucht\" is \"needs,\" \"sie\" is \"them,\" \"in 5 verschiedenen Farben\" is \"in 5 different colors.\" So she needs them (the crayons) in 5 different colors. So she needs 5 crayons, each of a different color. So 5 crayons total. Therefore, 5 * 2 = 10. 20 - 10 = 10. So the change is $10.\n\nI think that's correct. Unless there's a trick here, but I don't see it. The problem seems straightforward. So the answer is $10.\n</think>\n\nVioletta benötigt 5 Farbstifte in unterschiedlichen Farben, also insgesamt 5 Stifte.

The problem is about distributing 200 pounds of carrots to 40 restaurants, with each restaurant getting 2 pounds. The question is asking how many pounds of carrots will be left over, right? Hmm, so first, I need to figure out how much total carrots are needed for all the restaurants. \n\nSo, if each restaurant gets 2 pounds, and there are 40 restaurants, then the total amount needed would be 40 multiplied by 2. Let me calculate that. 40 times 2 is 80. So, the total required is 80 pounds. \n\nBut wait, the problem says there are 200 pounds of carrots available. So, if they only need 80 pounds, then the leftover would be 200 minus 80. Let me do that subtraction. 200 minus 80 is 120. So, 120 pounds of carrots won't be used. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Let me confirm the numbers again. 40 restaurants times 2 pounds each: 40*2=80. Total available is 200. So 200-80=120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nIs there any chance I misread the question? Like, maybe the problem is in German, and \"Pfund\" is pounds, so that's correct. The translation seems okay. The answer should be 120 pounds. I don't see any other factors here.

Like, maybe the distribution isn't possible because 200 isn't divisible by 40? But 200 divided by 40 is 5, so each restaurant would get 5 pounds if they split equally.

The problem is about finding out how many children live in the city of Soda. The total population is given as 23,786 inhabitants. Out of these, there are 8,417 men and 9,092 women. The rest are children. So, I need to figure out how many children there are.\n\nFirst, I should check if the numbers for men and women add up to something less than the total population. If I add 8,417 and 9,092 together, that should give me the number of adults, and then subtracting that from the total population should give the number of children.\n\nLet me do the addition first. 8,417 plus 9,092. Let's break it down. 8,000 + 9,000 is 17,000. Then 417 + 92 is 509. So adding those together, 17,000 + 509 = 17,509. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 8,417 + 9,092. Maybe another way: 8,417 + 9,000 = 17,417, then add 92 more, which is 17,417 + 92 = 17,509. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo the total number of adults (men and women) is 17,509. Now, subtract that from the total population to find the number of children. The total population is 23,786. So 23,786 minus 17,509. Let me calculate that.\n\nStarting with 23,786 - 17,509. Let's subtract step by step. 23,786 minus 17,000 is 6,786. Then subtract 509 more. 6,786 - 500 = 6,286. Then subtract 9 more: 6,286 - 9 = 6,277. So the number of children should be 6,277.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. Maybe using another method. Let's write it down vertically:\n\n23,786\n-17,509\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n6 - 9. Can't do that, so borrow from the tens place. The tens digit is 8, so it becomes 7, and the units become 16. 16 - 9 = 7.\n\nNext, tens place: 7 - 0 = 7.\n\nHundreds place: 7 - 5 = 2.\n\nThousands place: 3 - 7. Again, can't do that, so borrow from the ten-thousands place. The ten-thousands digit is 2, so it becomes 1, and the thousands digit becomes 13. Then 13 - 7 = 6.\n\nTen-thousands place: 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nSo putting it all together: 6,277. That matches my previous result. So the number of children is 6,277.\n\nBut let me check once more with another approach. If I add the number of children (6,277) to the adults (17,509), it should equal the total population. 17,509 + 6,277. Let's add them:\n\n17,509 + 6,000 = 23,509\n23,509 + 277 = 23,786. Yes, that's exactly the total population given. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6,277 children in Soda.\n</think>\n\nIn der Stadt Soda gibt es insgesamt 23.786 Einwohner.

The question says \"hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt.\" Hmm, \"gesammelt\" means collected, so maybe she collected 60 cards in the first month? Wait, but the original number was 20.

So maybe she collected 60 cards in the first month, making her total 20 + 60 = 80? Or is the total after the first month 60, meaning she collected 40 cards in the first month? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Elaine hatte anfänglich 20 Pokemonkarten. Nach einem Monat hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt.\" So \"anfänglich\" means initially, so she had 20. Then, after one month, she had collected three times this number. So \"dieser Zahl\" refers to the initial number, which is 20. So \"das Dreifache dieser Zahl\" is 3*20=60. But does that mean she collected 60 cards in the first month, or that her total is 60? The phrase \"hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt\" – \"hatte\" is past tense, so \"she had collected three times this number.\" So if she had 20 initially, and then collected 60, her total would be 20 + 60 = 80. But maybe the question is saying that after one month, her total is three times the initial number, so 3*20=60. That would mean she collected 40 cards in the first month. But the wording is a bit unclear. Let me think. If it's \"hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt,\" the \"gesammelt\" is the verb, so she collected three times the initial number. So she collected 60 cards in the first month. Therefore, her total after the first month is 20 + 60 = 80. But maybe the question is phrased as \"hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl,\" meaning her total is three times the initial number. That would be 60. So she collected 40 cards in the first month. Hmm. This is a common ambiguity in such problems. Let me check similar problems. Usually, when it says \"she had triple the number,\" it refers to the total. For example, if you start with 20 and then have triple that, it's 60. So maybe the total after the first month is 60, meaning she collected 40 cards in the first month. But the wording is \"gesammelt,\" which is \"collected,\" so maybe it's the amount she collected, not the total. So if she had 20 initially, and then collected 60, her total is 80. But the problem is in German, so maybe the translation is slightly different. Let me try to parse the German sentence again: \"Nach einem Monat hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt.\" \"Nach einem Monat\" – after one month, \"hatte sie\" – she had, \"das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt\" – collected three times this number. So \"dieser Zahl\" refers to the initial number, which is 20. So she collected 3*20=60 cards in the first month. Therefore, her total after the first month is 20 + 60 = 80. Then, in the second month, she collected 20 fewer than she did in the first month. So first month: 60, second month: 60 - 20 = 40. Then, in the third month, she collected double the number she collected in the first and second months combined. First and second months combined: 60 + 40 = 100. Double that is 200. So total cards collected over three months: 60 + 40 + 200 = 300. Then, adding the initial 20, total is 20 + 300 = 320. Wait, but if the first month's total was 80, then adding the second and third months? Wait, no. Wait, the initial 20 is separate. Then, each month she collects some cards. So total cards would be initial 20 plus the sum of the collected cards each month. So if first month she collected 60, second 40, third 200, total is 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320. But if the first month's total was 60 (meaning she collected 40), then the calculation would be different. Let me check again. If \"Nach einem Monat hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt,\" meaning that after one month, she had collected three times the initial number. So initial number is 20, so she collected 60 in the first month. Therefore, total cards after first month: 20 + 60 = 80. Then, second month: 20 less than first month, so 60 - 20 = 40. So total after second month: 80 + 40 = 120. Third month: double the amount collected in first and second months combined. First and second months combined: 60 + 40 = 100. Double that is 200. So total after third month: 120 + 200 = 320. So the answer would be 320. But if the first month's total was 60 (i.e., she collected 40), then first month: 20 + 40 = 60. Second month: 40 - 20 = 20. Third month: double of (40 + 20) = 120. Total: 60 + 20 + 120 = 200. But that would be 200. But which interpretation is correct? The key is the German sentence: \"Nach einem Monat hatte sie das Dreifache dieser Zahl gesammelt.\" The \"dieser Zahl\" refers to the initial number, which is 20. So \"das Dreifache dieser Zahl\" is 60. The verb is \"gesammelt,\" which is \"collected.\" So she collected 60 cards in the first month. Therefore, the total after first month is 20 + 60 = 80. Then, second month: 60 - 20 = 40. Third month: 2*(60 + 40) = 200. Total cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320. So I think that's the correct answer. But to be sure, let's check another way. If the problem had said \"Nach einem Monat hatte sie dreimal so viele Karten wie am Anfang,\" that would mean her total is three times the initial, so 60.

So the problem is about Mark, who is an editor. He corrects the same number of sentences every week for two different publishers, A and B. Publisher B pays him double what Publisher A pays. He corrects a total of 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. The question is, how much does Mark earn in a week in cents?\n\nAlright, first, let me parse the information. He works for two publishers, A and B. Each week, he corrects the same number of sentences for both. Wait, the problem says \"die gleiche Anzahl Sätze für zwei verschiedene Herausgeber\" – so that translates to \"the same number of sentences for two different publishers.\" So, he corrects the same number of sentences for each publisher. So if he does, say, x sentences for A, he does x sentences for B as well. Therefore, total sentences per week is x + x = 2x. And that total is given as 1000 sentences. So 2x = 1000, which means x = 500. So he does 500 sentences for A and 500 for B.\n\nThen, the rates. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Publisher B pays double that. So double of 5 cents is 10 cents per sentence for B.\n\nSo his earnings would be: for A, 500 sentences * 5 cents each, and for B, 500 sentences * 10 cents each. Then add those two amounts together.\n\nLet me calculate that. For A: 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. For B: 500 * 10 = 5000 cents. Total is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents. So Mark earns 7500 cents per week.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"Herausgeber B bezahlt Mark das Doppelte dessen, was Herausgeber A bezahlt.\" So B pays double what A pays. Since A pays 5 cents, B pays 10 cents. That's correct. And since he does 500 sentences for each, that's 500*5 + 500*10. Yes, that's 2500 + 5000 = 7500. So 7500 cents. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The key points are:\n\n- Same number of sentences for both publishers. So 500 each.\n\n- Rates: A is 5 cents, B is double that, so 10 cents.\n\nTotal sentences: 1000. So 500 each. So calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the total sentences are split differently, but the problem says \"die gleiche Anzahl Sätze für zwei verschiedene Herausgeber\", which means the same number for each. So 500 each. So I think that's right.\n\nAnother way: Let me think if there's another interpretation. Suppose \"die gleiche Anzahl Sätze\" refers to the same number each week, but maybe not split equally between the two publishers? But no, the wording is \"für zwei verschiedene Herausgeber, die ihm jeweils eine andere Rate pro Satz bezahlen.\" So \"jeweils\" here would mean each publisher pays a different rate. But the number of sentences per publisher is the same each week. So he does the same number for each, so 500 each. So the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 7500 cents.\n</think>\n\nMark bearbeitet jede Woche 1000 Sätze, wobei er die gleiche Anzahl (500 Sätze) für beide Herausgeber A und B korrigiert.

John won a prize at work. The prize is a one-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise. He earns $2000 per week and received the prize on the first day of the year. The question is, how much did he earn in that year?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out his total earnings for the year. That should include his regular salary plus the one-time prize and the raise. Wait, but the raise is 5%, so does that apply to his entire salary for the year or just after the prize? Hmm, the problem says he received the prize on the first day of the year, so the raise would probably be effective immediately, right? So his weekly salary increases by 5% from that point on.\n\nLet me break it down. His original weekly salary is $2000. A 5% raise would be 2000 * 0.05 = $100. So his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100 per week. But wait, does the raise apply to all weeks of the year or just after the prize? Since he got the prize on the first day of the year, I think the raise is effective from that day, so for the entire year, he would be earning the increased salary. But wait, the prize is a one-time monetary reward, so that's separate from the raise. So the $5000 is a one-time bonus, and the 5% raise is a permanent increase in his salary.\n\nSo his total earnings would be the one-time bonus plus his salary for the year with the 5% raise. Let me confirm that. The problem says the prize consists of a one-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise. So the raise is in addition to the bonus. So he gets $5000 upfront and then his salary increases by 5% for the rest of the year.\n\nBut wait, does the raise apply to his entire salary for the year, including the weeks before the raise? No, because the raise is given on the first day of the year. So if the raise is effective immediately, then his entire salary for the year is at the increased rate. But maybe the raise is applied after the first week? Wait, the problem says he received the prize on the first day of the year. So the raise would be effective from that day, meaning his salary for the entire year is increased by 5%. Therefore, his weekly salary is $2000 * 1.05 = $2100 per week.\n\nBut then, the $5000 is a one-time payment. So total earnings would be $5000 plus (number of weeks in the year * $2100). Wait, but is the $5000 part of his salary or a separate bonus? The problem says the prize consists of both the $5000 and the 5% raise. So the $5000 is a one-time payment, and the 5% raise is a permanent increase. Therefore, his total earnings would be the $5000 plus his salary for the year with the 5% raise.\n\nBut wait, does the raise apply to his salary before or after the $5000? If the raise is part of the prize, then maybe the $5000 is separate from his salary. So his salary is increased by 5%, and he also gets $5000 as a bonus. So the total would be (original salary * 1.05 * number of weeks) + $5000.\n\nBut I need to check if the raise is applied to his original salary or if the $5000 is part of the salary. The problem states: \"Der Preis besteht in einer 1-maligen monetären Belohnung in Höhe von 5000 $ und einer Lohnerhöhung von 5 %.\" So the prize consists of a one-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise. So the raise is in addition to the $5000. Therefore, his salary is increased by 5%, and he also receives $5000 as a bonus.\n\nTherefore, his total earnings for the year would be:\n\n- The one-time bonus: $5000\n- His salary for the year with the 5% raise: (original weekly salary * 1.05) * number of weeks in the year\n\nAssuming a standard year has 52 weeks. So 52 weeks * $2000 * 1.05 + $5000.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of weeks. The problem says \"jede Woche des Jahres\" which is \"every week of the year.\" Depending on the year, it could be 52 or 53 weeks. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think we can assume 52 weeks.\n\nSo calculating:\n\nOriginal weekly salary: $2000\n\nAfter 5% raise: 2000 * 1.05 = $2100 per week\n\nTotal salary for the year: 2100 * 52 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 2100 * 52. Well, 2000*52 = 104,000 and 100*52=5,200. So total is 104,000 + 5,200 = 109,200.\n\nThen add the one-time bonus of $5000: 109,200 + 5,000 = 114,200.\n\nWait, but is the $5000 included in the salary or is it separate? The problem says the prize consists of both the $5000 and the raise. So the $5000 is a separate bonus, not part of his salary. Therefore, the total earnings would be the salary with the raise plus the $5000.\n\nBut another way to think: if the raise is part of the prize, maybe the $5000 is part of the salary? But the wording says \"monetäre Belohnung\" which is a monetary reward, so it's separate from the salary. So the answer should be 109,200 + 5,000 = 114,200.\n\nBut let me check again. If he received the prize on the first day of the year, does that mean the raise is effective from that day, so his entire salary for the year is at the increased rate, and the $5000 is a one-time payment. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the raise was given as part of the prize, maybe the $5000 is the total of the raise and the bonus? But the problem says the prize consists of both a one-time payment and a raise. So they are separate components.\n\nTherefore, the total earnings would be $5000 + (2000 * 1.05 * 52) = 5000 + 109,200 = 114,200.\n\nBut wait, another thought: if the raise is 5% of his salary, does that mean the $5000 is part of the salary? No, because the raise is a percentage increase on his salary, not a fixed amount. So the $5000 is a separate bonus. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be $114,200.\n</think>\n\nJohn verdiente im Jahr 2000 folgende Summe:\n\n1. **Lohnerhöhung**:  \n   Sein ursprünglicher Wochenlohn beträgt $2000.

He had a sandwich for lunch every day this week. Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese. So, if he had a sandwich every day, that's 7 days, right? Wait, the problem says \"diese Woche\" which is \"this week,\" so assuming a week has 7 days. So, 7 days times 2 slices per sandwich. That would be 7 * 2 = 14 slices for the sandwiches.\n\nNext, for breakfast, he had egg-cheese omelets on 3 days. Each omelet used one more slice of cheese than he used per sandwich.

So, total slices would be 31.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For the sandwiches: 7 days * 2 = 14. Omelets: 3 days * 3 = 9. Mac and cheese: 8. 14 + 9 is 23, plus 8 is 31. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed any days or any parts of the problem. The key points are the three different uses of cheese: lunch sandwiches, breakfast omelets, and macaroni.

So, she had 32 pencils before buying the blue and red ones.\n\nNow, she bought 6 bags of blue pencils. Each bag has 9 pencils. So, 6 bags times 9 pencils per bag.

Brinley has taken five tests so far with scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. She's going to take a sixth test, and Mr. Bert allows her to drop the lowest score when calculating her average. She wants an average of 93. So, I need to figure out what she needs to score on the sixth test to achieve that average after dropping the lowest one.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which of her current five test scores is the lowest. Let me list them out: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86. The lowest here is 71, right? Because 71 is less than 86, 89, 92, and 100. So, she can drop that 71.\n\nNow, she has four tests left to consider for the average. Wait, no. Wait, she has six tests in total, but she can drop the lowest one. So, she has five tests already, and the sixth one is coming. So, when calculating the average, she can drop the lowest of all six tests. Wait, but the problem says \"jedes Semester, die niedrigste Punktzahl aus dem Durchschnitt zu streichen.\" So, does that mean she can drop the lowest score from the six tests, or from the five tests she's already taken?\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Er erlaubt den Studenten jedes Semester, die niedrigste Punktzahl aus dem Durchschnitt zu streichen.\" So, \"to drop the lowest score from the average.\" So, when calculating the average, they can drop the lowest score. So, if there are six tests, they can drop the lowest one, so the average is calculated over the remaining five.\n\nBut Brinley has already taken five tests, and is about to take the sixth. So, when she takes the sixth test, she will have six tests total. Then, she can drop the lowest one of those six. So, the question is, what score does she need on the sixth test so that when you drop the lowest of the six, the average of the remaining five is 93.\n\nSo, first, let's note her current five test scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86. The sixth test is unknown, let's call it x.\n\nSo, the six test scores are: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, x.\n\nShe can drop the lowest of these six. So, we need to figure out what x is such that when we drop the lowest score, the average of the remaining five is 93.\n\nBut here's the thing: depending on what x is, the lowest score might be different. For example, if x is lower than 71, then the lowest score would be x. If x is between 71 and 86, then the lowest is still 71. If x is between 86 and 89, the lowest is still 71. If x is between 89 and 92, same. If x is higher than 92, then the lowest is still 71. Wait, but 71 is already the lowest in the first five tests. So, unless x is lower than 71, the lowest score is 71. So, if x is less than 71, then the lowest is x. Otherwise, the lowest is 71.\n\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: x < 71. Then, the lowest score is x, so we drop x, and the average of the remaining five scores (89, 71, 92, 100, 86) is calculated. Wait, but if we drop x, then the remaining scores are the original five minus x? No, wait. Wait, the six tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, x. If x is the lowest, then we drop x, so the remaining five are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86. But that's the original five tests. Wait, but she already had those five tests. So, if x is the lowest, then the average would be (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86)/5. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, sum of the original five tests: 89 + 71 is 160, plus 92 is 252, plus 100 is 352, plus 86 is 438. So, 438 divided by 5 is 87.6. But she wants an average of 93. So, if x is the lowest, then the average is 87.6, which is less than 93. Therefore, in this case, even if she scores lower than 71, the average would be 87.6, which is not enough. Therefore, this case is not possible. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to 71, so that the lowest score is 71, which is dropped. Therefore, the remaining five scores are 89, 92, 100, 86, and x. Wait, no. Wait, if the lowest is 71, then we drop 71, so the five scores are 89, 92, 100, 86, and x. Wait, but x is the sixth test. So, if we drop the lowest (71), then the five scores are the other five: 89, 92, 100, 86, and x. Therefore, the average of these five is 93. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n(89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x)/5 = 93\n\nLet me compute the sum of the known scores: 89 + 92 is 181, plus 100 is 281, plus 86 is 367. So, 367 + x divided by 5 equals 93. Multiply both sides by 5: 367 + x = 465. Then, x = 465 - 367 = 98. So, x is 98. Therefore, she needs to score 98 on the sixth test.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that makes sense. If she scores 98, then her six tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, 98. The lowest is 71, so we drop that. The remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, 86, 98. Let's add those up: 89 + 92 = 181, +100 = 281, +86 = 367, +98 = 465. Divided by 5 is 93. Correct. So that works.\n\nBut wait, what if x is 71? Then, the scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, 71. The lowest is 71, so we drop one of them. So, the remaining five would be 89, 92, 100, 86, 71. Wait, but if you drop the lowest, which is 71, then you have to drop one instance of 71. So, the five scores would be 89, 92, 100, 86, and the other 71? Wait, no. Wait, if there are two 71s, then you can drop one of them. So, the remaining five would be 89, 92, 100, 86, and 71. Then, the average would be (89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 71)/5. Let's calculate that: 89 + 92 = 181, +100 = 281, +86 = 367, +71 = 438. Divided by 5 is 87.6, which is still less than 93. Therefore, even if she scores 71, the average is 87.6. Therefore, she needs to score higher than 71. Therefore, the previous calculation where x is 98 is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another scenario. Suppose x is higher than 71 but lower than 86. For example, if x is 85. Then, the scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, 85. The lowest is 71, so we drop that. The remaining five are 89, 92, 100, 86, 85. The average is (89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 85)/5. Let's compute that: 89 + 92 = 181, +100 = 281, +86 = 367, +85 = 452. Divided by 5 is 90.4, which is still less than 93. So, she needs a higher score.\n\nIf x is 98, as calculated, then the average is 93. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a case where x is the lowest, but even then, the average is not enough. But we saw that if x is the lowest, the average is 87.6, which is too low. Therefore, the only way to get the average up to 93 is to have x be high enough so that when you drop the original 71, the average of the other five (including x) is 93. Therefore, solving for x gives 98.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 98.\n</think>\n\nBrinley hat bereits fünf Testnoten: 89, 71, 92, 100 und 86.

Michael rides his bike a lot. The problem is asking how many kilometers he rode in total over a certain period. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he rode at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Each time, he covered 25 kilometers. Then, he changed his routine: he rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks, each time 60 kilometers. I need to calculate the total distance for both periods and add them together.\n\nStarting with the first part: 5 times a week for 4 weeks. So, 5 rides per week multiplied by 4 weeks. That would be 5 * 4 = 20 rides. Each ride is 25 km, so 20 * 25 km. Let me calculate that. 20 * 25 is 500 km. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow the second part: 2 times a week for 3 weeks. So, 2 * 3 = 6 rides. Each of these rides is 60 km. So, 6 * 60 km. Let me do that math. 6 * 60 is 360 km.\n\nAdding both parts together: 500 km + 360 km. That equals 860 km total. Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst period: 5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 20 rides. 20 * 25 = 500. Second period: 2 rides/week * 3 weeks = 6 rides. 6 * 60 = 360. Total is 500 + 360 = 860. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem mentions \"mindestens 5 Mal pro Woche\" which is \"at least 5 times a week,\" but since it says he did that for four weeks, I assume he did exactly 5 times each week. Otherwise, if it was \"at least,\" maybe there's a range, but the problem doesn't specify varying numbers, so I think it's safe to take it as exactly 5 times. Same with the second part, he decided to ride 2 times a week, so exactly 2 each week.

So the problem is about Joe's Halloween candy bag. There are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. And each chocolate bar is 40 grams. The question is asking for the total weight of Joe's candy bag in grams.\n\nAlright, first, I need to figure out the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as a candied apple, and the chocolate bar is 40 grams, then the candied apple must be half of that. Let me check that. If the chocolate bar is twice the weight of the apple, then apple weight = chocolate bar weight divided by 2. So 40 grams divided by 2 is 20 grams per candied apple. That makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total weight of all the chocolate bars and all the candied apples separately, then add them together for the total weight.\n\nStarting with the chocolate bars: there are 25 of them, each weighing 40 grams. So 25 multiplied by 40 grams. Let me do that calculation. 25 times 40... Well, 25 times 4 is 100, so 25 times 40 is 1000 grams. So the chocolate bars total 1000 grams.\n\nNext, the candied apples: there are 80 of them, each weighing 20 grams. So 80 multiplied by 20 grams. Hmm, 80 times 20. Let me think. 8 times 2 is 16, so 80 times 20 is 1600 grams. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 80 times 20. Let me break it down. 80 times 10 is 800, so 80 times 20 is 1600. Yeah, that's correct. So the candied apples total 1600 grams.\n\nNow, adding both totals together: 1000 grams (chocolates) plus 1600 grams (apples) equals 2600 grams. So the total weight of Joe's candy bag is 2600 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. For the chocolate bars: 25 times 40. 25 times 40. 25*40. 25*4=100, so 25*40=1000. That's correct. For the apples: 80*20. 80*20. 8*2=16, so 80*20=1600. Yes, that's right. Then 1000+1600=2600. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think that's all. The key steps were figuring out the weight of each candied apple by using the given ratio, then multiplying the number of each candy by their respective weights, and adding them up. No steps seem to be missing here. The answer should be 2600 grams.\n</think>\n\nJoe's Süßigkeitentüte besteht aus 25 Schokoladenriegeln und 80 kandierte Äpfeln.

She went to another store and bought five times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday. Wait, so that's five times Tuesday's amount. Since Tuesday was 12, then Wednesday would be 5 * 12. Let me do that math: 5 * 12 = 60. So Wednesday she bought 60 cakes.\n\nTo find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, I need to add up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday's totals. That would be 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday). Let me add those numbers together. \n\nFirst, 4 + 12 is 16. Then 16 + 60 is 76. So the total should be 76 cakes.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Monday is definitely 4. Tuesday is three times Monday, so 3*4=12, that's right. Wednesday is five times Tuesday, so 5*12=60. Then adding them up: 4+12=16, 16+60=76. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem mentions different stores each day, but the numbers are just multiplied each day based on the previous day's count. So the answer should be 76.\n</think>\n\nRose kaufte am Montag 4 Kuchen.

I need to figure out the total cost for buying each cup. The problem says that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost for half a dozen plates, each sold for $6000. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the units here. A dozen is 12, right? So twenty dozen cups would be 20 times 12. Let me calculate that: 20 * 12 = 240 cups. So, 240 cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates divided by 2, which is 3 plates. Wait, no, half a dozen is 6 divided by 2? Wait, no. A dozen is 12, so half a dozen is 6. Wait, the problem says \"ein halbes Duzend Teller\", which is half a dozen plates. So that's 6 plates. Each plate is sold for $6000. So the total cost for half a dozen plates would be 6 plates times $6000 each. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"die Gesamtkosten für ein halbes Duzend Teller, das jeweils zu 6000 $ verkauft wird.\" So \"jeweils\" means each, right? So each plate is sold for $6000. Therefore, half a dozen plates is 6 plates, each at $6000. So total cost for the plates would be 6 * 6000. Let me compute that: 6 * 6000 = 36,000 dollars.\n\nNow, the problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this total. So the cost of the cups is 36,000 minus 1,200. Let me calculate that: 36,000 - 1,200 = 34,800 dollars. So the total cost for twenty dozen cups is $34,800.\n\nBut the question is asking for the total cost for the purchase of each cup. Wait, does that mean the cost per cup or the total cost for all the cups? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original question again: \"Berechnen Sie die Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse.\" \"Gesamtkosten\" means total costs, and \"für den Kauf jeder Tasse\" would be \"for the purchase of each cup.\" Hmm, that might be a translation issue. If it's \"each cup,\" then it's the cost per cup. But \"Gesamtkosten\" is total costs, so maybe it's the total cost for all the cups? But the way it's phrased is confusing. Let me think.\n\nIf it's asking for the total cost for buying each cup, that might be the cost per cup. But maybe the original German is clearer. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the total cost for the purchase of all the cups, which would be the $34,800 we calculated. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Zwanzig Duzend Tassen kosten 1200 $ weniger als die Gesamtkosten für ein halbes Duzend Teller, das jeweils zu 6000 $ verkauft wird.\" So \"Zwanzig Duzend Tassen kosten...\" which is \"Twenty dozen cups cost...\" and then \"1200 $ weniger als die Gesamtkosten für ein halbes Duzend Teller...\" So the total cost for twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost for half a dozen plates. So we calculated the total cost for the plates as 6 * 6000 = 36,000, then subtract 1200 to get the total cost for the cups: 34,800. So if the question is asking for the total cost for the purchase of the cups, that would be 34,800. But the original question says \"die Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse.\" \"Jeder Tasse\" is \"each cup,\" so maybe it's the cost per cup. That would make more sense. Because if it's asking for the total cost for each cup, that would be the price per cup. So maybe I need to calculate the cost per cup.\n\nSo if twenty dozen cups cost 34,800 dollars, then how much is that per cup? Let's see. Twenty dozen is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. So total cost is 34,800 for 240 cups. Therefore, the cost per cup would be 34,800 divided by 240. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, divide 34,800 by 240. Let's simplify. 240 goes into 34,800 how many times? Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 3,480 / 24. Then divide numerator and denominator by 12: 3,480 ÷ 12 = 290, and 24 ÷ 12 = 2. So now it's 290 / 2 = 145. So 145 dollars per cup. Wait, that seems high, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, 240 cups for 34,800. Let's divide 34,800 by 240. 240 * 100 = 24,000. 34,800 - 24,000 = 10,800. 240 * 45 = 10,800. So 100 + 45 = 145. Yes, that's correct. So each cup costs $145. Therefore, the total cost for each cup is $145. But the question says \"Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse,\" which is \"total costs for the purchase of each cup.\" If \"each cup\" is singular, then it's the cost per cup, which is $145. If it's asking for the total cost for all the cups, it's $34,800. But given the wording, I think it's more likely asking for the cost per cup, which is $145. Let me check the original problem again to be sure.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Zwanzig Duzend Tassen kosten 1200 $ weniger als die Gesamtkosten für ein halbes Duzend Teller, das jeweils zu 6000 $ verkauft wird. Berechnen Sie die Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse.\"\n\nSo \"Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse\" – \"total costs for the purchase of each cup.\" The term \"Gesamtkosten\" is total costs, but \"jeder Tasse\" is each cup. So maybe it's the total cost for each cup, which would be the cost per cup. But \"Gesamtkosten\" is total, so maybe it's the total cost for all the cups. However, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. If it's asking for the total cost for each cup, that would be the price per cup. If it's asking for the total cost for the purchase of all the cups, that would be the total amount spent on the cups, which is $34,800. But given that the problem gives the price per plate and asks for the cost per cup, it's more likely that they want the cost per cup. Let me think again.\n\nIf the answer is $145 per cup, that seems reasonable. But let me check the calculation once more. Total cost for cups: 36,000 - 1,200 = 34,800. Number of cups: 20 dozen = 240. 34,800 divided by 240 is indeed 145. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be $145 per cup. But the question says \"Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse,\" which is \"total costs for the purchase of each cup.\" If \"each cup\" is singular, then it's the cost per cup. If it's plural, maybe it's the total for all. But in German, \"jeder Tasse\" is singular, so \"each cup.\" Therefore, the answer is $145 per cup. So I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nDie Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse betragen **145 $**.\n\n**Schritt-für-Schritt-Erklärung:**\n\n1. **Berechnung der Anzahl der Tassen:**\n   - 20 Dutzend Tassen = $20 \\times 12 = 240$ Tassen.\n\n2. **Berechnung der Gesamtkosten für die Teller:**\n   - Ein halbes Dutzend Teller = 6 Teller.\n   - Jeder Teller kostet 6000 $, also: $6 \\times 6000 = 36.000 $.\n\n3. **Berechnung der Gesamtkosten für die Tassen:**\n   - Die Tassen kosten 1200 $ weniger als die Teller: $36.000 - 1.200 = 34.800 $.\n\n4. **Berechnung des Preises pro Tasse:**\n   - $ \\frac{34.800}{240} = 145 $ $.\n\n**Antwort:** Die Gesamtkosten für den Kauf jeder Tasse betragen **145 $**."]], "filtered_resps": ["145"], "doc_hash": "aed8e255455dc5e4156a5c8fbb0e72312c0af1af01b09fc39e77ed74b998ccf1", "prompt_hash": "d286cf3e33d187229b75d74821e61cb7bd4a8664370e34f4186ac40d98174434", "target_hash": "be47addbcb8f60566a3d7fd5a36f8195798e2848b368195d9a5d20e007c59a0c", "exact_match": 1.0}

Sara wants to buy a new jacket and two pairs of shoes. The jacket is $30, and each pair of shoes is $20. So first, I need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants. That would be 30 for the jacket plus 2 times 20 for the shoes. Let me write that down: 30 + 2*20. That's 30 + 40, which equals 70 dollars total.\n\nNow, Sara already has $10 saved up. So she needs to earn the remaining amount. The total she needs is $70, and she has $10, so she needs 70 - 10 = $60 more.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how much she can earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time. So that's 4 * 5 = $20 from babysitting. Then, she can also mow the lawn, and her parents pay her $4 each time she does that. The question is asking how many times she needs to mow the lawn to get the remaining money after babysitting.\n\nWait, but does she do both babysitting and mowing the lawn? The problem says she hütet die Nachbarskinder 4 Mal (which is babysitting) and earns $5 each time. Then, her parents pay her $4 each time she mäht den Rasen (mows the lawn). So she can do both activities. But the question is, how often does she need to mow the lawn in addition to the babysitting? Or is the babysitting already done, and she needs to mow the lawn on top of that?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Wenn Sara bereits 10 $ gespart hatte, bevor sie zu Hüten anfing...\" So she already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. Then she babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time. So that's 4*5 = $20. Then, she can also mow the lawn, which gives her $4 each time. So the total amount she can earn is from babysitting and mowing the lawn. But the question is, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to reach the total needed?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"wie oft muss sie dann den Rasen mähen, bevor sie sich die Jacke und die Schuhe leisten kann?\" So after she has already done the babysitting (4 times) and has the $10 saved, how many times does she need to mow the lawn?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if the babysitting is part of her earning or not. The problem says she hütet die Nachbarskinder 4 Mal and earns $5 each time. So that's part of her earnings. Then, she can also mow the lawn for $4 each time. So the total amount she can earn is from both activities. But the question is, how many times does she need to mow the lawn in addition to the babysitting?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"bevor sie zu Hüten anfing\" she had $10. Then, she starts babysitting 4 times, earning $20. Then, she can also mow the lawn. So the total money she has is $10 (initial) + $20 (from babysitting) + $4 * x (from mowing the lawn). She needs this total to be at least $70.\n\nSo let's set up the equation:\n\n10 (initial) + 4*5 (from babysitting) + 4*x (from mowing) ≥ 70\n\nCalculating that:\n\n10 + 20 + 4x ≥ 70\n\nSo 30 + 4x ≥ 70\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n4x ≥ 40\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nx ≥ 10\n\nSo she needs to mow the lawn 10 times. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again.\n\nTotal needed: $70\n\nShe has $10 already. Then she does 4 babysitting jobs, earning $5 each: 4*5=20. So total after babysitting: 10 + 20 = 30. Then she needs 70 - 30 = 40 more. Each mowing gives her $4, so 40 / 4 = 10. Yes, that's 10 times. So the answer is 10.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"wie oft muss sie dann den Rasen mähen, bevor sie sich die Jacke und die Schuhe leisten kann?\" So after she has already done the babysitting, how many times does she need to mow the lawn? So the answer is 10 times. That seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother way: total cost is 70. She has 10, so needs 60 more.

Jerry has a flock of hens, some red and some white. The red hens lay 3 eggs per day, and the white ones lay 5 eggs per day. Every day, he collects 42 eggs. Also, he has two more white hens than red hens. The question is, how many red hens does he have?\n\nAlright, so I need to set up some equations here. Let me think. Let me denote the number of red hens as R. Then, since he has two more white hens than red ones, the number of white hens would be R + 2. That makes sense.\n\nNow, each red hen lays 3 eggs a day, so the total eggs from red hens would be 3 times R, which is 3R. Similarly, each white hen lays 5 eggs, so the total from white hens is 5 times (R + 2), which is 5(R + 2). The total eggs collected each day is 42, so adding those two together should equal 42.\n\nSo the equation would be: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42. Let me check that again. Yes, that seems right. Let me expand that equation.\n\nFirst, distribute the 5 into the parentheses: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42. Combine like terms: 3R + 5R is 8R, so 8R + 10 = 42. Then subtract 10 from both sides: 8R = 42 - 10, which is 32. Then divide both sides by 8: R = 32 / 8 = 4. So R is 4. Therefore, Jerry has 4 red hens.\n\nWait, let me verify that. If there are 4 red hens, then white hens are 4 + 2 = 6. The eggs from red hens would be 4 * 3 = 12 eggs. The eggs from white hens would be 6 * 5 = 30 eggs. Total eggs would be 12 + 30 = 42. Which matches the given total. So that checks out.\n\nHmm, seems straightforward. Did I miss anything? Let me think again. The problem says \"Hühnerschar\" which is a flock of hens. So hens are female chickens, right? So they lay eggs. The problem mentions \"roten Hennen\" and \"weißen Hennen\", so red hens and white hens. So the numbers are correct. The equations are set up properly. The answer seems to be 4 red hens. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: suppose R = 4, then white hens = 6. 4*3=12, 6*5=30. 12+30=42.

Gary walks around the local park, which is a rectangle measuring 1.5 miles by 6 miles. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The question is asking how many hours he spends walking. Hmm, so I need to figure out the total distance he walks around the park and then divide that by his speed to get the time.\n\nFirst, the park is a rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by the formula: 2*(length + width). So, the length here is 6 miles, and the width is 1.5 miles. Let me plug those numbers in. 2*(6 + 1.5) = 2*(7.5) = 15 miles. So the perimeter is 15 miles. That means each time he goes around the park, he walks 15 miles.\n\nNow, he walks at 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, I can use the formula: time = distance / speed. So, time = 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours. Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, the problem says he goes \"rund um den Rand\" which is German for \"around the edge\" or \"around the perimeter.\" So, he's walking the perimeter once? The question doesn't specify how many laps he does, but the way it's phrased, \"wie viele Stunden verbringt er dann mit Gehen?\" translates to \"how many hours does he spend walking?\" So, if he walks around the park once, that would be 15 miles, which at 3 mph takes 5 hours. But maybe the question is implying that he walks around the park multiple times? Wait, the original problem doesn't mention multiple laps. It just says he goes around the edge. So, I think it's just one lap.\n\nBut let me check again. The park is 1.5 by 6 miles. Perimeter is 2*(1.5 + 6) = 2*7.5 = 15 miles. Speed is 3 mph. Time is 15 / 3 = 5 hours. That seems right. So the answer should be 5 hours. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the perimeter calculation? Let me verify that again. Length is 6, width is 1.5.

The problem is about Sloane counting customers in a one-euro shop over three days. The question is asking how many customers she counted on the third day, given some information about the first two days and the total for the third day. Wait, actually, the problem says that the total number of customers on the third day was 500. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nOriginal question: \"Während sie in einem Ein-Euro-Shop ist, zählt Sloane 100 Kunden, die den Laden betreten. Am nächsten Tag zählt sie 50 Kunden mehr als am ersten Tag. Wenn die Gesamtzahl der Kunden am Dritten Tag 500 betrug, wie viele Kunden zählte sie dann am dritten Tag?\"\n\nTranslation: While she is in a one-euro shop, Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store. The next day, she counts 50 more customers than on the first day. If the total number of customers on the third day was 500, how many customers did she count on the third day?\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. The problem says that on the third day, the total was 500, and then asks how many she counted on the third day. That would just be 500, right? But that seems too straightforward. Maybe there's a translation error or a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nLet me check again. The original German says: \"Wenn die Gesamtzahl der Kunden am Dritten Tag 500 betrug, wie viele Kunden zählte sie dann am dritten Tag?\" So, if the total number of customers on the third day was 500, how many did she count on the third day? That would be 500. But that seems like the answer is given in the question. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's translation or structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured differently. Let me parse it again step by step.\n\nFirst day: Sloane counts 100 customers.\n\nSecond day: She counts 50 more than the first day. So that would be 100 + 50 = 150 customers.\n\nThird day: The total number of customers was 500. Wait, but the question is asking how many she counted on the third day. If the total is 500, then the answer is 500. But that seems too simple. Maybe the problem is in German, and there's a translation nuance. Maybe \"Gesamtzahl der Kunden am Dritten Tag\" refers to the total over the three days? But that would be different.\n\nWait, let's think again. If the problem says that on the third day, the total number of customers was 500, then the answer is 500. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the total number of customers over the three days is 500, and we need to find the number on the third day. But the original question says \"am Dritten Tag\" which is \"on the third day.\" So the wording is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's translation. Let me check the original German again:\n\n\"Während sie in einem Ein-Euro-Shop ist, zählt Sloane 100 Kunden, die den Laden betreten. Am nächsten Tag zählt sie 50 Kunden mehr als am ersten Tag. Wenn die Gesamtzahl der Kunden am Dritten Tag 500 betrug, wie viele Kunden zählte sie dann am dritten Tag?\"\n\nSo, the first day: 100 customers.\n\nSecond day: 50 more than first day, so 150.\n\nThird day: Gesamtzahl der Kunden am Dritten Tag 500. So, the total number of customers on the third day was 500. Then the question is, how many did she count on the third day? That would be 500. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem is supposed to say that the total number of customers over the three days is 500, and we need to find the third day's count. Let's try that.\n\nIf that's the case, then total over three days is 500. First day: 100, second day: 150, third day: x. Then 100 + 150 + x = 500. So x = 500 - 250 = 250. Then the answer would be 250. But the original problem says \"am Dritten Tag 500 betrug,\" which is \"on the third day, the total number was 500.\" So that would mean the third day's count is 500. But that seems odd because the question is then asking for the third day's count, which is given. So there must be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. Maybe \"Gesamtzahl der Kunden am Dritten Tag\" is supposed to mean the total number of customers over the three days, but mistranslated. If that's the case, then the answer would be 250. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as follows: On the first day, she counts 100. On the second day, 50 more than the first day, so 150. On the third day, she counts some number, and the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Then, the third day's count would be 500 - 100 - 150 = 250. But the problem says \"die Gesamtzahl der Kunden am Dritten Tag 500 betrug,\" which is \"the total number of customers on the third day was 500.\" So that would mean the third day's count is 500, which is given. Therefore, the answer is 500. But that seems too simple, so I think there's a translation error here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem was in German and the user made a mistake in the translation. For example, maybe it's supposed to say \"die Gesamtzahl der Kunden in den drei Tagen\" (the total number of customers over the three days) was 500. Then the answer would be 250. But given the current wording, the answer is 500. However, since the user is asking for the third day's count, and the problem states that the total on the third day was 500, the answer is 500. But that seems too straightforward, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the user made a mistake in the question. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal question: \"Während sie in einem Ein-Euro-Shop ist, zählt Sloane 100 Kunden, die den Laden betreten. Am nächsten Tag zählt sie 50 Kunden mehr als am ersten Tag.

So, the total number of customers on the third day was 500. Then the question is, how many did she count on the third day? That would be 500. But that seems like the answer is given. Therefore, maybe the problem is mistyped, and the total over three days is 500. In that case, the answer would be 250. But without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation of \"Gesamtzahl der Kunden am Dritten Tag.\" Maybe \"Gesamtzahl\" refers to the total over the three days, but the preposition \"am\" (on) is confusing. If it's \"die Gesamtzahl der Kunden in den drei Tagen betrug 500,\" then the answer would be 250. But with the current wording, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but assuming that the problem is likely intended to have the total over three days as 500, then the answer would be 250. However, strictly based on the given text, the answer is 500. But since the user is asking for the third day's count, and the problem states that the total on the third day was 500, the answer is 500. However, this seems too straightforward, so I think there's a mistake in the problem statement.

So, Jerry has two swimming pools, both with leaks losing 4 gallons per minute. The problem says that four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small one. Now, the big pool has four times as much as the small one. We need to find out how much water the small pool has now.\n\nHmm, let me start by defining variables. Let me think. Let's let the current amount of water in the small pool be S gallons. Then, the big pool would have 4S gallons now, since it's four times as much. But wait, that's now. But four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small one. So, I need to consider how much water has leaked out in those four minutes.\n\nBoth pools are losing water at 4 gallons per minute. So, in four minutes, each pool would have lost 4 minutes * 4 gallons/minute = 16 gallons. Wait, but is that correct? Wait, the leak rate is 4 gallons per minute for each pool, right? So each pool is losing 4 gallons every minute. Therefore, over four minutes, each pool would lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. So, if I consider the amount of water in each pool four minutes ago, it would be the current amount plus 16 gallons, because they've been losing water since then.\n\nWait, but if the current amount is S for the small pool, then four minutes ago, the small pool had S + 16 gallons. Similarly, the big pool now has 4S, so four minutes ago it had 4S + 16 gallons. But according to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small pool. So, that gives me an equation: 4S + 16 = 2*(S + 16). Let me check that.\n\nWait, hold on. If the pools are losing water, then the amount of water they have now is less than what they had four minutes ago. So, if I want to find out how much they had four minutes ago, I need to add the amount that has leaked out since then. So, yes, if now the small pool has S, then four minutes ago it had S + 4*4 = S + 16. Similarly, the big pool now has 4S, so four minutes ago it had 4S + 16. And that should be equal to twice the amount the small pool had four minutes ago, which is 2*(S + 16). So the equation is 4S + 16 = 2*(S + 16). Let me solve that.\n\nExpanding the right side: 2S + 32. So, 4S + 16 = 2S + 32. Subtract 2S from both sides: 2S + 16 = 32. Subtract 16: 2S = 16. Therefore, S = 8. So the small pool now has 8 gallons. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I did that correctly.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the small pool now has S gallons. Four minutes ago, it had S + 16 gallons. The big pool now has 4S gallons, so four minutes ago it had 4S + 16 gallons. And according to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small pool. So 4S + 16 = 2*(S + 16). Solving that gives 4S +16 = 2S +32, so 2S = 16, S=8. So the answer is 8 gallons. That seems right.\n\nBut let me verify with numbers. If the small pool now has 8 gallons, then four minutes ago it had 8 + 16 = 24 gallons. The big pool now has 4*8 = 32 gallons, so four minutes ago it had 32 + 16 = 48 gallons. And 48 is indeed twice 24. So that checks out. So the answer is 8 gallons. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: Let me define variables differently. Let me let the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago be x. Then, the big pool had 2x. Now, after four minutes, the small pool has x - 4*4 = x - 16 gallons. Similarly, the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons. According to the problem, now the big pool has four times the small pool. So 2x - 16 = 4*(x - 16). Let's solve that.\n\n2x -16 = 4x -64. Subtract 2x: -16 = 2x -64. Add 64: 48 = 2x. So x = 24. Therefore, the small pool now has x -16 = 24 -16 = 8 gallons. Same answer. So that's consistent. So that confirms it. So the answer is 8 gallons. Therefore, the small pool now has 8 gallons.\n\nI think that's correct. Both methods give the same result, and the check works. So I think the answer is 8 gallons.\n</think>\n\nJerry hat zwei Swimmingpools, die beide mit 4 Gallonen pro Minute leaken. Vor 4 Minuten hatte der große Pool doppelt so viel Wasser wie der kleine.

So the total amount she has to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200. \n\nBut wait, the question says she's paying $165 per month for 12 months. Let me check that. 12 months times $165 per month would be 12 * 165. Let me calculate that. 12 * 160 is 1920, and 12 * 5 is 60, so total is 1920 + 60 = $1980. \n\nSo she's paying $1980 over 12 months, but the total amount she needs to pay back is $2200. That means she hasn't paid the full amount yet. The question is asking for her remaining balance after 12 months of payments. \n\nSo the remaining balance would be the total amount she owes minus the total amount she has paid. That would be $2200 - $1980. Let me do that subtraction. 2200 - 1980. 2200 - 1900 is 300, and then subtract another 80, so 300 - 80 = $220. \n\nWait, but is the interest simple interest or compound interest? The problem says she promised to pay the amount with additional 10%, which sounds like simple interest. So the total amount is indeed $2200. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 10% is annual interest, and she's paying monthly. But the problem doesn't specify compounding, so I think it's safe to assume simple interest. Therefore, the total amount is $2200. \n\nSo after paying $1980, the remaining balance is $220. Therefore, the answer should be $220. \n\nBut let me double-check. If she borrowed $2000 and has to pay back 10% more, that's $2200 total. She pays $165 each month for 12 months, which is $1980. So $2200 - $1980 = $220. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think there's any mention of the interest being compounded monthly or anything like that.

That makes sense.\n\nNow, to find the total number of flowers, I need to add the number of roses and dahlias together. So, 4 roses plus 11 dahlias. Let me do that math. 4 + 11 is 15. Hmm, that seems straightforward. \n\nWait, is there any chance I misread the question? Let me read it again. \"Es gibt 4 Rosen in der Vase. Es gibt 7 Dahlien mehr als Rosen in der Vase. Wie viele Blumen gibt es insgesamt in der Vase?\" So, yes, 4 roses, 7 more dahlias than roses. Total flowers would be roses plus dahlias. So 4 + (4 +7) = 4 +11=15. That seems correct. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to first find the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses, then adding both quantities together. Yeah, that should be it. The answer should be 15.\n</think>\n\nEs gibt 4 Rosen in der Vase.

I need to find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years. Right now, Harriet is 21 years old. The problem says Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, and Harriet is half as old as Zack. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note down what we know. Harriet's current age is 21. So, Harriet = 21. Now, Adrian is three times as old as Harriet. That means Adrian's current age is 3 * Harriet's age. Let me calculate that: 3 * 21 = 63. So Adrian is 63 years old now.\n\nNext, Harriet is half as old as Zack. Wait, if Harriet is half as old as Zack, that means Zack is twice as old as Harriet. So Zack's current age would be 2 * Harriet's age. Let me check that. If Harriet is 21, then Zack is 2 * 21 = 42. So Zack is 42 years old now.\n\nNow, the question asks for the average age of the three in three years. So I need to find their ages in three years and then compute the average.\n\nLet's calculate each person's age in three years. For Harriet: she is currently 21, so in three years she'll be 21 + 3 = 24. Adrian is currently 63, so in three years he'll be 63 + 3 = 66. Zack is currently 42, so in three years he'll be 42 + 3 = 45.\n\nNow, to find the average age, I need to add up their ages in three years and divide by 3. Let's add them up: 24 (Harriet) + 66 (Adrian) + 45 (Zack) = 24 + 66 is 90, and 90 + 45 is 135. Then divide by 3: 135 / 3 = 45. So the average age in three years is 45.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24. Adrian: 3*21=63, plus 3 is 66. Zack: 2*21=42, plus 3 is 45. Sum: 24 + 66 = 90, 90 + 45 = 135. 135 divided by 3 is indeed 45. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: maybe I can calculate the current average and then add 3 years to each person's age. The current average age would be (21 + 63 + 42)/3. Let's see: 21 + 63 = 84, 84 + 42 = 126. 126 / 3 = 42. Then, in three years, each person's age increases by 3, so the average would increase by 3 as well. So 42 + 3 = 45. That matches my previous result. So that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the average age in three years is 45. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nHarriet ist derzeit 21 Jahre alt. \n\n- **Adrians Alter**: 3 × Harriets Alter = 3 × 21 = **63 Jahre**.\n- **Zacks Alter**: 2 × Harriets Alter = 2 × 21 = **42 Jahre**.\n\nIn drei Jahren:\n- Harriet: 21 + 3 = **24 Jahre**.\n- Adrian: 63 + 3 = **66 Jahre**.\n- Zack: 42 + 3 = **45 Jahre**.\n\n**Durchschnittsalter in drei Jahren**:\n$$\n\\frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \\frac{135}{3} = \\boxed{45}\n$$\n\n**Antwort:** Das Durchschnittsalter der drei in drei Jahren beträgt **45 Jahre**."]], "filtered_resps": ["45"], "doc_hash": "830a75d0adb27e5e8ba63cb334fdbd602b1aa7bab2861cd4fb53013081dfaafc", "prompt_hash": "8f3db5129c199f07cca530bd0a137916c213d23a1c4f18fadfa8305e10255b9d", "target_hash": "811786ad1ae74adfdd20dd0372abaaebc6246e343aebd01da0bfc4c02bf0106c", "exact_match": 1.0}

There are four students: Naomi, Yuri, Brianna, and Jojo. Together they scored 251 points in a board game. I need to find out how many points Jojo scored. \n\nFirst, let me note down the information given:\n\n- Total points: 251\n- Naomi's points: 68\n- Yuri's points: 10 more than half of Naomi's points\n- Brianna's points: 17 more than Naomi's points\n\nSo, the problem is asking for Jojo's points. Since the total is the sum of all four students' points, if I can find the points of the other three, I can subtract their total from 251 to get Jojo's score.\n\nLet me start by calculating Yuri's points. The problem says Yuri scored 10 points more than half of what Naomi scored. Naomi scored 68, so half of that is 68 divided by 2. Let me compute that: 68 / 2 = 34. Then, adding 10 points to that gives Yuri's score: 34 + 10 = 44. So Yuri has 44 points.\n\nNext, Brianna's points. She scored 17 more than Naomi. Naomi has 68, so Brianna's points are 68 + 17. Let me add that: 68 + 17 = 85. So Brianna has 85 points.\n\nNow, let's sum up the points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. That would be 68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna). Let me add those numbers step by step. \n\nFirst, 68 + 44. 60 + 40 is 100, and 8 + 4 is 12, so total is 112. Then, adding 85 to that: 112 + 85. Breaking it down: 100 + 80 = 180, 12 + 5 = 17, so total is 180 + 17 = 197. \n\nSo the three students have a combined total of 197 points. The total for all four is 251, so Jojo's points would be 251 - 197. Let me compute that. 251 - 197. Hmm, 251 - 200 would be 51, but since it's 197, which is 3 less than 200, I need to add 3 back. So 51 + 3 = 54. Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.\n\nWait, let me check that subtraction again to be sure. 251 minus 197. Let's do it another way: 197 + 54 = 251? Let's see: 197 + 50 = 247, then +4 = 251. Yes, that's correct. So Jojo has 54 points.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Naomi: 68\n- Yuri: 44\n- Brianna: 85\n- Jojo: ?\n\nTotal of the three: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197. Total overall: 251. So 251 - 197 = 54. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. Let me just verify each step once more.\n\nNaomi's points are given as 68. Half of that is 34, plus 10 is 44 for Yuri. Correct. Brianna is 68 +17 = 85. Correct. Summing them: 68 + 44 is 112, plus 85 is 197. Total points 251, so 251 - 197 is indeed 54. So Jojo scored 54 points. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\nNaomi erzielte 68 Punkte.

The question is, how much water is in the tank now?\n\nAlright, first step: figure out how much water is left after Celine uses 90 liters. The tank started with 120 liters. If she takes out 90, then the remaining amount would be 120 minus 90. Let me calculate that: 120 - 90 = 30 liters. So there's 30 liters left after she waters the garden.\n\nNow, the next part says she collects two times as much rainwater as what was left. So the amount of rainwater she collects is 2 times the remaining 30 liters. Let me do that multiplication: 2 * 30 = 60 liters. So she adds 60 liters of rainwater back into the tank.\n\nNow, to find the total amount of water in the tank now, I need to add the remaining 30 liters to the 60 liters of rainwater. So 30 + 60 = 90 liters. Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nOriginal amount: 120 liters. Minus 90 used: 30 left. Then adding twice that amount (which is 60) gives 30 + 60 = 90. Yeah, that seems right. Hmm, but wait, is there any chance that the problem is worded differently? Like, does \"two times as much rainwater as was left\" mean something else? For example, maybe she collected rainwater equal to twice the original amount? But no, the wording says \"als noch übrig war,\" which translates to \"as was left,\" so it's definitely twice the remaining 30 liters. So 60 liters added. So total is 30 + 60 = 90 liters. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just visualize it again. Start with 120. Use 90, so 30 left. Then collect 2*30=60. So total is 30 + 60 = 90.

Hmm, maybe it's that he plants 90 geraniums and the number of petunias is 40 less than the number of geraniums. So, petunias = geraniums - 40. That would make sense. So if he plants 90 geraniums, then petunias would be 90 - 40 = 50. Then total flowers would be 90 + 50 = 140. But let me make sure I'm interpreting the sentence correctly. The original German is \"90 Geranien und 40 Petunien weniger als Geranien.\" So \"40 Petunien weniger als Geranien\" – that would mean 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So yes, petunias = geraniums - 40. So 90 geraniums, 50 petunias. Total is 140. That seems straightforward. I don't see any other interpretation.

So the problem is about Carlos and Benji renting stuff at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour, and Benji rents a banana water slide for $18 per hour. Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours, and Benji uses the water slide for 5 hours. We need to find out how much they pay in total.\n\nAlright, first, I need to calculate each of their individual costs and then add them together. Let me start with Carlos. He rents the canoe at $30 per hour for 3 hours. So that should be 30 multiplied by 3. Let me do that math. 30 times 3 is 90. So Carlos pays $90 for the canoe.\n\nNow Benji has the banana water slide. It's $18 per hour, and he uses it for 5 hours. So that's 18 multiplied by 5. Hmm, 18 times 5. Let me think. 10 times 5 is 50, and 8 times 5 is 40, so 50 plus 40 is 90. Wait, that's 90? Wait, no, 18 times 5. Wait, 10*5=50, 8*5=40, so 50+40=90? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 18*5 is actually 90? Let me check again. 18*5: 10*5=50, 8*5=40, 50+40=90. Yeah, that's correct. So Benji also pays $90 for the water slide.\n\nSo then, adding both amounts together: Carlos's $90 plus Benji's $90. That would be 90 + 90 = 180. So total they pay $180 together.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Sometimes I mix up numbers. Let me verify again. For Carlos: 30 dollars per hour times 3 hours. 30*3 is definitely 90. For Benji: 18*5. Let me do it another way. 18*5 is the same as (20-2)*5 = 20*5 - 2*5 = 100 - 10 = 90. Yeah, that checks out. So both of them paid $90 each, so total is $180. That seems right.\n\nI don't think there are any other costs mentioned here. The problem says they each rent their own items, so there's no shared cost or anything. So adding their individual costs should be the total. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer should be $180.\n</think>\n\nCarlos zahlt für das Kanu:  \n$30 \\, \\text{USD/h} \\times 3 \\, \\text{h} = 90 \\, \\text{USD}$.  \n\nBenji zahlt für den Bananen-Wasserschlitten:  \n$18 \\, \\text{USD/h} \\times 5 \\, \\text{h} = 90 \\, \\text{USD}$.  \n\nGesamtkosten:  \n$90 \\, \\text{USD} + 90 \\, \\text{USD} = 180 \\, \\text{USD}$.  \n\n**Antwort:** Sie zahlen insgesamt **180 $**."]], "filtered_resps": ["180"], "doc_hash": "a96f9fc4ca7454e2e894725ec1585d6cfe785390128a9a2e498d56931e7ffd59", "prompt_hash": "8c0849fd4b114019083eeaf59f3799253871a4b98d51df5590d6505d4cd67a89", "target_hash": "7b69759630f869f2723875f873935fed29d2d12b10ef763c1c33b8e0004cb405", "exact_match": 1.0}

Andrew is planning a trip from New Jersey to Rochester. The question is about how many days he will travel if he takes the bus to Rochester and then drives back. \n\nFirst, the problem states that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. Then, it says that driving takes half as many days as the bus. So, if the bus takes 6 days, then driving would take 6 divided by 2, which is 3 days. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the total number of days he travels when he goes by bus and returns by car. So, going by bus is 6 days, and returning by car is 3 days. So, adding those together, 6 + 3 equals 9 days total. \n\nBut let me double-check. The problem says \"es dauert 6 Tage, um mit dem Bus zu reisen\" – that's the time for the bus trip one way. Then \"halb so viele Tage, um mit dem Auto\" – so half of 6 is 3 days for the car trip.

James has some Pokémon cards, and I need to figure out the probability that a randomly drawn card is a Water-type after he moves some and buys more. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial counts: 30 Fire, 20 Grass, and 40 Water. So total cards at the beginning would be 30 + 20 + 40. Let me add that up. 30 + 20 is 50, plus 40 is 90. So he starts with 90 cards.\n\nNow, he moves 8 Water-type cards. Moving them... does that mean he removes them from his collection? I think so. So the Water-type cards go down by 8. So 40 - 8 = 32 Water-type cards left.\n\nThen he buys 14 Grass-type cards. So Grass-type increases by 14. Original Grass was 20, so 20 + 14 = 34 Grass-type cards.\n\nSo now, the new counts are: Fire remains 30, Grass is 34, and Water is 32. Let me check that again. Yes, he only changed Water and Grass. Fire stays the same.\n\nNow, the total number of cards after these changes. Let's calculate that. Fire (30) + Grass (34) + Water (32). 30 + 34 is 64, plus 32 is 96. So total cards now are 96.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that a randomly drawn card is Water-type. So that would be the number of Water-type cards divided by the total number of cards, then converted to a percentage.\n\nSo, 32 Water-type out of 96 total. Let me compute that fraction. 32 divided by 96. Hmm, simplifying that. Both numbers are divisible by 32? 32 ÷ 32 is 1, 96 ÷ 32 is 3. So 1/3. Wait, 1 divided by 3 is approximately 0.3333... So as a percentage, that's 33.333...%.\n\nBut the question says to round to the nearest whole number. So 33.333...% rounds to 33%. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal counts: 30 Fire, 20 Grass, 40 Water. Total 90. Then he moves 8 Water, so 40 - 8 = 32. Then buys 14 Grass, so 20 +14=34. So new total is 30 +34 +32 = 96. Correct. Then 32/96 = 1/3 ≈ 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest whole number is 33%. But wait, sometimes when you round, if it's exactly .5, you round up. But here it's .333..., which is less than .5, so it should round down to 33%.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Maybe I miscalculated the total? Let me add 30 + 34 + 32 again. 30 + 34 is 64, 64 +32 is 96. Yes. 32 divided by 96. Let me do the division again. 32 ÷ 96. Well, 96 divided by 3 is 32, so 32 is 1/3 of 96. So 1/3 is approximately 33.333...%. So yes, 33.33%, which rounds to 33%.\n\nWait, but sometimes in probability questions, they might expect you to use decimal places or something else. But the question says to round to the nearest whole number, so 33.33% is definitely 33% when rounded. So the answer should be 33%.\n\nBut let me check once more if I interpreted the problem correctly. He \"verlegt\" 8 Water-type cards. \"Verlegen\" in German can mean moving them somewhere else, but in the context of counting cards, does that mean removing them from his collection? If he moves them to another pile or gives them away, then yes, they are no longer in his collection. So the count decreases by 8. Then he buys 14 Grass-type, so that's adding to his collection. So the total number of cards is original 90 minus 8 (moved) plus 14 (bought). So 90 -8 +14 = 96. Which matches my previous total. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 32/96 = 1/3 ≈ 33.33%, which rounds to 33%.

So there's this watermelon farm that produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went after two months and found that 30% were ripe, so she took those home. Then two weeks later, she came back and found that 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe, so she harvested those. The question is asking how many watermelons were not ripe after the two weeks.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, the total number of watermelons is 120. When Ashlyn first visits, 30% are ripe. So I need to calculate 30% of 120. Let me do that. 30% is 0.3 in decimal, so 0.3 times 120. Let me compute that: 0.3 * 120 = 36. So she took 36 watermelons home. That means the remaining watermelons after her first visit would be 120 - 36 = 84. Got that.\n\nNow, two weeks later, she comes back and finds that 3/4 of the remaining watermelons are ripe. The remaining watermelons at that point are 84. So 3/4 of 84 are ripe. Let me calculate that. 3/4 of 84 is (3/4)*84. Let me compute that. 84 divided by 4 is 21, and 21 times 3 is 63. So 63 watermelons were ripe at that time, and she harvested those. \n\nThe question is asking how many were not ripe after the two weeks. So after the second harvest, the number of unripe watermelons would be the remaining watermelons after the second harvest. Wait, but let me make sure. The problem says that when she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining were ripe, so she harvested those. Therefore, the ones that were not ripe would be the remaining 1/4 of the 84. Because if 3/4 were ripe, then 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 were not ripe. So 1/4 of 84 is 21. Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ripe after the two weeks.\n\nWait, but let me check again. First, initial total is 120. First harvest: 30% of 120 is 36, so 120 - 36 = 84 left. Then, two weeks later, 3/4 of 84 are ripe, so 3/4 * 84 = 63 harvested. Therefore, the remaining unripe would be 84 - 63 = 21. Yes, that's the same as 1/4 of 84. So 21 is the answer. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. The question says \"wie viele Melonen waren nach den zwei Wochen nicht reif, um geerntet zu werden?\" So after the two weeks, when she came back, she harvested the 3/4 that were ripe, so the ones that were not ripe would be the remaining 1/4. So yes, 21. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking about after both harvests?

Mark is buying 12 cars for his company. Each car costs $20,000. Then there's a 10% tax on the cars, and an additional $1,000 per car for registration. I need to figure out the total amount he pays for everything.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total cost of the cars without any taxes or registration. That would be 12 cars multiplied by $20,000 each. Let me do that: 12 * 20,000. Hmm, 12 times 20,000 is 240,000. So the base cost is $240,000.\n\nNext, the tax is 10% on the cars. So I need to calculate 10% of $240,000. 10% of 240,000 is 24,000. So the tax adds another $24,000.\n\nThen there's the registration fee. It's $1,000 per car, and there are 12 cars. So that's 12 * 1,000. That's straightforward: 12,000.\n\nNow, I need to add all these amounts together. The base cost is $240,000, tax is $24,000, and registration is $12,000. Adding them up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000. Then 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that right. 240k plus 24k is 264k, then plus 12k is 276k. Yeah, that seems correct. So the total amount Mark pays is $276,000.\n\nBut wait, is the tax applied to each car individually or on the total? The question says \"10% Steuer auf die Autos\", which translates to \"10% tax on the cars\". So I think that's 10% of the total car cost, which is what I did. If it were per car, it would be 10% of each $20,000, but that would be the same as 10% of the total. Either way, the total tax would be the same. So that part is okay.\n\nAnd the registration is $1,000 per car, so 12 cars would be 12,000. That seems right. So adding all together, 240k +24k +12k = 276k.

The problem is about Kylie and Robert collecting shells at the beach. I need to figure out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that on Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, who collected 20 shells. So, Robert's total on Monday is 20. Then Kylie has 5 more than that. So, Kylie's Monday collection would be 20 + 5. Let me write that down: Kylie on Monday = 20 + 5 = 25 shells. That seems straightforward.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Wait, the wording here is important. \"2-mal mehr\" in German translates to \"twice as many\" or \"two times more.\" But sometimes in English, \"2 times more\" can be ambiguous. However, in many contexts, especially in math problems, \"2 times more\" usually means multiplying the original amount by 2. So if Kylie collected 25 on Monday, then on Tuesday she collects 2 * 25. Let me check that again. If it's \"2-mal mehr,\" that's \"two times more,\" which in German typically means 2 times the original amount. So yes, 25 * 2 = 50. Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no trick here. Let me re-read the problem. \"Am Dienstag sammelt Kylie 2-mal mehr Muscheln, als sie am Montag sammelte.\" So \"2-mal mehr\" than Monday's amount. So if Monday was 25, then Tuesday is 2 times that, which is 50. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might confuse \"2 times more\" as \"original plus twice as much,\" but in most mathematical contexts, especially in problems like this, it's just twice the original. So 25 * 2 = 50. So the answer should be 50.\n\nLet me just confirm the steps again. Robert has 20 on Monday. Kylie has 5 more, so 25. Then Tuesday is 2 times that, so 50. Yep, that seems correct. I don't see any other numbers or steps involved here. The problem is straightforward once you parse the German terms correctly. \"2-mal mehr\" is definitely twice as many.

Let me parse that. \"Halb sie viele Käfer wie Ameisen\" – maybe it's supposed to be \"halb so viele Käfer wie Ameisen\"? That would make sense. So, half as many beetles as ants. So if there are 50 ants, then beetles are half of that. So beetles would be 50 divided by 2, which is 25. Then the total insects would be ants plus beetles, so 50 + 25 = 75.

So his friend must eat 3 per day, right? Because 6 divided by 2 is 3. But actually, the problem says Steve eats twice as many as his friend, so Steve's amount is double his friend's. So if Steve eats 6, then his friend eats 3. But maybe the question is only about Steve's consumption? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem states: \"Er isst doppelt so viele wie seine Freundin.

So the problem is about Ram who buys 25 pens. He can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen.

Then he can collect the ink from those empty pens to make new ones. The key here is that every five empty pens can be turned into one new pen.

Use that, get 1 empty pen. Now he has 1 empty pen, which isn't enough to make another. So total pens used would be 25 + 5 + 1 = 31? Wait, but the question is asking how many pens he can have in total when the ink runs out. So maybe the total number of pens he can have is the original 25 plus the ones he made from recycling?\n\nWait, but when he uses the pens, they become empty, but the new pens he makes are added to his total. So the total number of pens he can have is the original 25 plus the ones he made from recycling. But when he uses the recycled pens, they also become empty, so he can make more. So the total number of pens he can have is the sum of all the pens he made through the process.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"wie viele Stifte kann er dann insgesamt haben?\" which translates to \"how many pens can he have in total when the ink runs out?\" So maybe it's the total number of pens he can use, including the ones he made from recycling. Let me think again.\n\nFirst, he buys 25 pens. He uses them all, so he has 25 empty pens. Then he makes 5 new pens. Now he has 5 pens. He uses those 5, so now he has 5 empty pens. Then he makes 1 new pen. He uses that 1, so he has 1 empty pen. So total pens used: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. But the total number of pens he has is 25 original plus 5 + 1 = 31. But when the ink runs out, he can't make any more. So the answer is 31?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to collect the empty pens from the new ones. Let me check again. Let's track the number of empty pens he has after each step.\n\nStart with 25 pens. He uses them all, so he has 25 empty pens. Then he makes 5 new pens. So he uses 25 empty pens to make 5 new ones. Now he has 5 pens. He uses those 5, so he has 5 empty pens. Then he makes 1 new pen. Now he has 1 pen. He uses that, so he has 1 empty pen. Now he can't make any more. So total pens he has used: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. But the total number of pens he has is 25 original plus 5 + 1 = 31. So the answer is 31?\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is using the formula for such problems. It's similar to the classic problem where you have bottles and you can exchange empty bottles for new ones. The formula is usually total = initial + floor(initial / (n-1)), where n is the number needed to exchange. Wait, but maybe not exactly. Let me recall.\n\nIn the classic problem, if you have 10 bottles and you can exchange 3 empty bottles for 1 new one, how many can you drink? The answer is 14: 10 + 3 + 1 = 14. Because after drinking 10, you have 10 empties. Exchange 9 for 3 new, drink them, now you have 3 empties + 1 left from the initial 10, so 4. Exchange 3 for 1, drink it, now you have 1 + 1 = 2 empties. So total is 10 + 3 + 1 = 14.\n\nBut in this case, the exchange rate is 5 empties for 1 new. So starting with 25 pens. Let's apply the same logic.\n\nFirst, 25 pens used, 25 empties. Exchange 25 / 5 = 5 new pens. Now, 5 pens used, 5 empties. Exchange 5 / 5 = 1 new pen. Now, 1 pen used, 1 empty. Can't exchange. Total pens used: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. So same as before.\n\nBut in the classic problem, the formula is total = initial + floor(initial / (n-1)). Wait, but here n is 5. So 25 + floor(25 / (5-1))? Wait, 25 / 4 is 6.25, floor is 6. But that would be 25 + 6 = 31. Which matches. So maybe the formula is total = initial + floor(initial / (n-1)). But why?\n\nWait, the formula for the classic problem where you can exchange k empties for 1 new. The total number of drinks is initial + floor( (initial - 1) / (k - 1) ). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me check with the example. If you have 10 bottles, exchange 3 for 1. Then total is 10 + 3 + 1 = 14. Which is 10 + floor(10 / 2) = 10 + 5 = 15? No, that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is total = initial + floor( (initial - 1) / (k - 1) ). For the 10 bottles, k=3: (10-1)/(3-1) = 9/2 = 4.5, floor is 4. So total is 10 + 4 = 14. Which matches. So in this case, with initial=25, k=5: (25-1)/(5-1) = 24/4 = 6. So total is 25 + 6 = 31. Which matches our previous result. So that seems to be the formula.\n\nSo applying that formula here, the answer is 31. Therefore, the total number of pens he can have is 31.\n\nBut let me verify again with the step-by-step process:\n\nStart with 25 pens. Use them all, 25 empties. Exchange 25 / 5 = 5 new pens. Now, 5 pens used, 5 empties. Exchange 5 / 5 = 1 new pen. Now, 1 pen used, 1 empty. Total pens used: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. So yes, that's 31.\n\nBut wait, when he exchanges the 25 empties for 5 new pens, he uses up 25 empties to get 5 new. Then he uses those 5, which gives 5 empties. Then exchanges those 5 for 1 new. Uses that 1, gives 1 empty. So total empties after all is 1. So the total number of pens he has is 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 31.\n</think>\n\nRam beginnt mit 25 Stiften. Jede dieser Stifte wird verwendet und wird zu einem leeren Stift.

The problem is about figuring out the sum of the ages of three girls: Mary, Joan, and Jessa. The information given is that Mary is two years younger than Joan, and Joan is five years older than Jessa. Also, we know that Jessa is 20 years old. The question is asking for the total of their ages.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the relationships between their ages. Let me start by writing down what I know. Jessa's age is given directly as 20. Then, Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, Joan's age should be Jessa's age plus five. That would be 20 + 5, which is 25. So Joan is 25 years old.\n\nNext, Mary is two years younger than Joan. Since Joan is 25, Mary's age would be Joan's age minus two. That would be 25 - 2, which is 23. So Mary is 23 years old.\n\nNow, to find the sum of their ages, I need to add up Jessa's age, Joan's age, and Mary's age. Let me do that step by step. Jessa is 20, Joan is 25, and Mary is 23. Adding those together: 20 + 25 is 45, and then 45 + 23 is 68. So the total sum should be 68.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Jessa is 20. Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so 20 + 5 = 25. That seems right. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so 25 - 2 = 23. Then adding them all up: 20 + 25 + 23. Let me add 20 and 25 first, which is 45, then 45 + 23. 45 + 20 is 65, plus 3 more is 68. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nI think that's all.

I need to figure out how many students left through exit C. The total number of students is 1000. There are three exits: A, B, and C. \n\nFirst, the problem says that 30% of the students went out through exit A. So, I should calculate 30% of 1000. Let me do that. 30% is the same as 0.30 in decimal form. So, 0.30 multiplied by 1000 equals 300. That means 300 students left through A.\n\nNow, after that, there are some students left. The total was 1000, and 300 went through A, so the remaining students would be 1000 minus 300. That's 700 students left. \n\nNext, the problem states that 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. So, I need to find 3/5 of 700. Let me compute that. 3 divided by 5 is 0.6, so 0.6 multiplied by 700. Let me do the math: 700 times 0.6. Hmm, 700 times 0.5 is 350, and 700 times 0.1 is 70, so adding those together gives 350 + 70 = 420. So, 420 students left through B.\n\nNow, the rest of the students went through exit C. The remaining students after A and B would be the original 1000 minus those who left through A and B. So, 1000 - 300 (A) - 420 (B) = 1000 - 720 = 280.

Let me just verify the calculations once more to be sure. 30% of 1000 is definitely 300. Then 700 remaining. 3/5 of 700: 700 divided by 5 is 140, times 3 is 420. Correct. Then 700 - 420 is 280.

Let me start by breaking down the information given.\n\nFirst, it says James has 6 more candies than Robert. So if I let the number of candies Robert has be a variable, maybe R, then James would have R + 6 candies. That makes sense because James has 6 more than Robert.\n\nNext, John has twice as many candies as Robert. So if Robert has R candies, John has 2 times R, which is 2R.

Let me write that down:\n\n2R = 54  \nR = 54 / 2  \nR = 27\n\nSo Robert has 27 candies. Now, since James has 6 more than Robert, James would have 27 + 6.

The question is about Dolly and Pandora and how many books they will read in total if they both read each other's books and their own. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. So initially, Dolly has 2, Pandora has 1. Now, the problem says they both read the books from each other and their own. Wait, does that mean each of them reads the other's books plus their own? Or does it mean they exchange books and then read all of them?\n\nLet me parse the sentence again: \"Wenn Dolly und Pandora beide die Bücher voneinander und ihre eigenen lesen...\" So \"both read the books from each other and their own.\" So each of them reads the other's books and their own. So Dolly reads Pandora's books (which is 1) plus her own (2). Pandora reads Dolly's books (2) plus her own (1). So total books read by both would be Dolly's total plus Pandora's total.\n\nBut wait, does that count duplicates? Like, if they both read the same books, are we supposed to count each instance or just the unique books? The question says \"wie viele Bücher werden sie dann insgesamt lesen?\" which translates to \"how many books will they read in total?\" So maybe it's the total number of books read by both, counting each person's reading separately. So Dolly reads 1 (Pandora's) + 2 (her own) = 3 books. Pandora reads 2 (Dolly's) + 1 (her own) = 3 books. So total is 3 + 3 = 6 books. But wait, that would be 6 books in total. But maybe the question is asking for the number of unique books they read together? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal question: \"wie viele Bücher werden sie dann insgesamt lesen?\" The German word \"insgesamt\" means \"in total\" or \"altogether.\" If it's about the total number of books read by both, considering each person's reading, then it's 3 + 3 = 6. But if it's about the unique books, then Dolly has 2, Pandora has 1, so total unique books are 3. But the way the question is phrased, \"beide die Bücher voneinander und ihre eigenen lesen\" suggests that each reads the other's books plus their own. So Dolly reads 1 (Pandora's) + 2 (her own) = 3. Pandora reads 2 (Dolly's) + 1 (her own) = 3. So total is 3 + 3 = 6. But maybe the answer is 3, considering that they are reading the same books. Wait, but the question is about how many books they will read in total. If each reads their own and the other's, then each person reads 3 books, so combined 6. But maybe the answer is 3 because there are only 3 unique books. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again.\n\nIf Dolly has two books, let's call them Book A and Book B. Pandora has one book, Book C. When they read each other's books and their own, Dolly reads Book C (Pandora's) plus her own A and B. So she reads 3 books. Pandora reads A and B (Dolly's) plus her own C. So she also reads 3 books. So total books read by both are 3 + 3 = 6. But the actual number of distinct books is 3 (A, B, C). However, the question is about \"wie viele Bücher werden sie dann insgesamt lesen?\" which could be interpreted as the total number of books read by both, not the unique ones. So the answer would be 6. But maybe in German, \"Bücher\" here refers to the total count, not unique. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they are reading the same books, so the total unique is 3. But the way it's phrased, \"beide die Bücher voneinander und ihre eigenen lesen\" might mean that each reads the other's books and their own, leading to each reading 3 books, so total 6. But I need to be careful here. Let me check similar examples. If someone has 2 books and another has 1, and they exchange and read all, the total number of books read would be 2 (Dolly's) + 1 (Pandora's) + 1 (Pandora's) + 2 (Dolly's) = 6? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, Dolly reads her own 2 and Pandora's 1, so 3. Pandora reads her own 1 and Dolly's 2, so 3. Total is 3 + 3 = 6. So the answer is 6. But maybe the question is in German, and sometimes in such problems, they might consider the total unique books. But the wording here is \"wie viele Bücher werden sie dann insgesamt lesen?\" which is \"how many books will they read in total?\" So if each reads 3, then 6. But maybe the answer is 3, considering that they are reading the same books. But I think the correct interpretation is that each person reads their own and the other's, so total is 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nDolly hat 2 Bücher und Pandora 1 Buch.

Mike had 5 pen pals, but he stopped corresponding with 2 of them. So now he's only writing to 3 people, right? Each of those 3 sends him 2 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Then he responds in the same way, meaning he writes 2 letters per week to each of them, each 5 pages. He can write one page every 6 minutes. The question is, how many hours does he spend writing per week?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many letters Mike writes in total each week. Since he's corresponding with 3 people, and each person gets 2 letters from him per week. So that's 3 people * 2 letters = 6 letters. Each letter is 5 pages, so total pages he writes is 6 letters * 5 pages = 30 pages.\n\nBut wait, does he also have to read the letters he receives? The problem says he sends 2 letters per week to each of the 3 people, but it doesn't mention reading the incoming letters. The question specifically asks about the time he spends writing, not reading. So maybe we don't need to consider the incoming letters. The problem states that the other 2 people he stopped corresponding with, so he's only dealing with the 3 remaining. Each of those 3 sends him 2 letters, but he doesn't have to respond to those anymore? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So he's only writing to the remaining 3. But does that mean he's only sending letters to them, or also receiving letters from them? The problem says \"Sie senden ihm jeweils 2 Briefe pro Woche, die 5 Seiten lang sind.\" So the 3 people send him 2 letters each week, each 5 pages. Then he responds in the same way. So he sends them 2 letters each week, each 5 pages. So he has to write 2 letters per person, 3 people, so 6 letters, each 5 pages. So total pages he writes is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.\n\nThen, he can write one page every 6 minutes. So total time is 30 pages * 6 minutes per page. That would be 180 minutes. Then convert that to hours: 180 / 60 = 3 hours. So the answer is 3 hours per week.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"Sie senden ihm jeweils 2 Briefe pro Woche, die 5 Seiten lang sind. Er antwortet auf die gleiche Weise.\" So \"they send him 2 letters per week, each 5 pages. He responds in the same way.\" So \"the same way\" would mean he sends 2 letters per week to each of them, each 5 pages. So yes, that's 2 letters per person, 3 people, so 6 letters. Each 5 pages. So 30 pages. 30 pages * 6 minutes = 180 minutes = 3 hours. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to consider that he receives letters from them as well. But the question is about the time he spends writing. If he receives letters, does he have to read them? The problem doesn't mention that. It only mentions the time he spends writing. So the only writing he does is when he responds to their letters. Since he sends 2 letters per week to each of the 3 people, each 5 pages. So that's 3*2*5=30 pages. 30 pages *6 minutes=180 minutes=3 hours. So the answer is 3 hours. That seems straightforward.

The question is, how many minutes does Jason have left?\n\nFirst, I need to calculate how many minutes he uses talking to his boss. Since he does this every day for 30 days, that's 15 minutes per day times 30 days. Let me do that multiplication: 15 * 30. Hmm, 15 times 10 is 150, so 15 times 30 is 450 minutes.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, Griffin initially had 24 fries. Then Kyle took 5 of them. So, after Kyle took his share, Griffin would have 24 minus 5, which is 19 fries left. \n\nNext, Billy took double what Kyle took. Since Kyle took 5, Billy took 2 times 5, which is 10 fries. So, subtracting that from Griffin's remaining fries, 19 minus 10 would leave Griffin with 9 fries. \n\nNow, Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \"x\". So after receiving x fries from Ginger, Griffin's total would be 9 plus x. \n\nThen, Colby took 3 fewer fries than what Kyle had taken. Kyle took 5, so Colby took 5 minus 3, which is 2 fries. Therefore, Griffin's total after Colby took his share would be (9 + x) minus 2, which simplifies to 7 + x. \n\nThe problem states that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27. Solving for x, we subtract 7 from both sides, which gives x = 20. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me go through each step once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with 24 fries. Kyle takes 5: 24 - 5 = 19. Billy takes double Kyle's amount, so 5*2=10. 19 -10 = 9. Then Ginger gives x fries: 9 + x. Then Colby takes 5 -3 = 2 fries. So 9 + x -2 = 7 + x. And that equals 27. So 7 + x =27, so x=20. That seems right. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm if I interpreted Colby's action correctly. The problem says Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle. Kyle took 5, so 5-3=2. Yes, that's correct. So Colby took 2. \n\nSo, yes, the equation is correct. Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no other interpretation. For example, could \"doppelt so viele wie Kyle\" mean something else? No, \"doppelt so viele\" is definitely double the amount Kyle took. And \"eine Handvoll\" is just a handful, which we represent as x. \n\nAnother check: If Ginger gave 20, then after that, Griffin had 9 +20=29. Then Colby took 2, so 29-2=27. Which matches the final amount. Yep, that works. So the answer should be 20.\n</think>\n\nGriffin begann mit 24 Pommes frites. Kyle nahm 5, sodass Griffin 19 übrig hatte.

There are two aquariums with snails and fish. The first one has 4 snails, the second one has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined. And both aquariums have the same number of fish. I need to find out how many fish are in each aquarium.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 minus 4, which is 28. So that difference is 28. According to the problem, this difference (28) is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Wait, but the problem says \"der Unterschied zwischen der Anzahl Schnecken in den zwei Aquarien entspricht dem Doppelten der Anzahl Fische in beiden Aquarien.\" So the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. And both aquariums have the same number of fish. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both have the same number, the total number of fish in both aquariums combined is x + x = 2x. The difference in snails is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, 28 = 2 * (total number of fish). So 28 = 2 * 2x? Wait, no. Wait, the total number of fish is 2x, so twice that would be 2*(2x) = 4x? Wait, no, the problem says the difference in snails is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So the difference is 28 = 2 * (total fish). So total fish is 28 / 2 = 14. Therefore, since total fish is 2x, 2x = 14, so x = 7. Therefore, each aquarium has 7 fish.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again. The difference in snails is 32 - 4 = 28. The problem says this difference is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So 28 = 2 * (fish in first + fish in second). Since both have the same number of fish, fish in first = fish in second = x. Therefore, total fish is 2x. So 28 = 2*(2x) => 28 = 4x => x = 7. Wait, that's different from my first calculation. Wait, which is correct?\n\nWait, the problem says \"dem Doppelten der Anzahl Fische in beiden Aquarien\". So \"twice the number of fish in both aquariums\". So if the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x, then twice that would be 2*(2x) = 4x. Therefore, 28 = 4x => x = 7. So each aquarium has 7 fish. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check again. If each aquarium has 7 fish, then total fish is 14. Twice that is 28, which matches the difference in snails. Yes, that works. So the answer is 7 fish in each aquarium.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the problem. Let me check once more. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. This difference is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So 28 = 2*(fish in first + fish in second). Since both have the same number of fish, fish in first = fish in second = x. Therefore, 28 = 2*(x + x) = 2*(2x) = 4x. Therefore, x = 7. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 7 fish in each aquarium.\n\nI think that's it. The key was to correctly interpret the problem statement and set up the equation properly. Initially, I thought maybe the total fish is 2x, so twice that is 4x, leading to x=7. That seems right. Let me just confirm with numbers. If each aquarium has 7 fish, then total fish is 14. Twice that is 28, which is exactly the difference in snails. Perfect, that matches.

I need to figure out how much Jean paid the makeup artist. The problem says the makeup artist charges $250 per hour. Jean needs very expensive makeup for a movie she's in. Each day, it takes 6 hours to do the makeup, and she has to get it done 4 times a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish. After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done. So, I need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 10% discount.\n\nFirst, let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, how many hours does Jean spend on makeup each day? It's 6 hours per day. Then, how many times a week does she need it done? 4 times a week. So, per week, the total hours would be 6 hours/day * 4 days/week. That would be 24 hours per week.\n\nThen, the movie takes 5 weeks. So, over the entire duration of the movie, the total hours would be 24 hours/week * 5 weeks. Let me calculate that: 24 * 5 = 120 hours. \n\nNow, the makeup artist charges $250 per hour. So, the total cost before the discount would be 120 hours * $250/hour. Let me compute that. 120 * 250. Hmm, 100*250 is 25,000, and 20*250 is 5,000, so total is 25,000 + 5,000 = $30,000. \n\nBut then there's a 10% discount after the movie is finished. So, the discount is 10% of $30,000. Let me calculate that. 10% of 30,000 is 3,000. So, subtracting that from the total cost: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me check again. \n\nEach day: 6 hours. 4 days a week: 6*4=24 hours per week. 5 weeks: 24*5=120 hours. 120 hours * $250 = $30,000. Then 10% discount: 30,000 * 0.10 = 3,000. So total paid is 30,000 - 3,000 = 27,000. That seems right. \n\nBut wait, is the discount applied after the total hours? The problem says \"nachdem der Film fertig ist, gibt der Maskenbildner Jean 10 % Rabatt wegen der Menge der getanen Arbeit.\" So, after the film is finished, the makeup artist gives a 10% discount. So, the discount is on the total amount. So yes, the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the discount is applied per hour? But the problem says \"wegen der Menge der getanen Arbeit,\" which translates to \"because of the amount of work done,\" so it's likely a total discount on the entire amount. So, 10% off the total. \n\nTherefore, Jean paid $27,000. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the hours. Let me recheck:\n\nEach day: 6 hours. 4 times a week. So per week: 6*4=24 hours. 5 weeks: 24*5=120 hours. Correct. \n\nTotal cost before discount: 120 * 250 = 30,000. Then 10% discount: 30,000 * 0.10 = 3,000. So 30,000 - 3,000 = 27,000.

Isabelle bought party supplies for her sister's birthday. She spent different amounts on various things: $12 on cake ingredients, $43 on birthday gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on bags of snacks for the guests. Now, she's splitting the total cost equally with her two parents, so three people in total. The question is, how much does each person pay?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total amount Isabelle spent. Let me add up all those numbers. Let me write them down again to make sure I don't miss any:\n\n- Cake ingredients: $12\n- Birthday gifts: $43\n- Decorations: $15\n- Invitations: $4\n- Snacks: $22\n\nSo adding those up. Let me do it step by step. Starting with the cake ingredients and birthday gifts: 12 + 43. Hmm, 12 + 40 is 52, plus 3 is 55. Then add decorations: 55 + 15. That's 70. Then invitations: 70 + 4 = 74. Then snacks: 74 + 22. 74 + 20 is 94, plus 2 is 96. So total cost is $96?\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I added wrong. Let me add them all again:\n\n12 (cake) + 43 (gifts) = 55. Then 55 + 15 (decorations) = 70. Then 70 + 4 (invitations) = 74. Then 74 + 22 (snacks) = 96. Yeah, that seems right. So total is $96.\n\nNow, she splits this cost equally with her two parents, so three people total. So each person pays 96 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 96 divided by 3. Well, 3 times 30 is 90, so 30 with 6 left over. 6 divided by 3 is 2. So 30 + 2 = 32. So each person pays $32.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. 3 times 32 is 96. Yes, because 30*3=90 and 2*3=6, so 90+6=96. Correct. So the answer should be $32 per person.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding the initial amounts. Let me add them again:\n\n12 + 43 = 55. Then 55 +15 = 70. 70 +4 =74. 74 +22 = 96. Yes, that's correct. So total is indeed 96. Divided by 3 is 32. So each person pays $32. That seems straightforward. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem says she splits the costs with her two parents, so three people. So yeah, 96 divided by 3 is 32. So the answer is 32 dollars.\n</think>\n\nIsabelle gab insgesamt $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 aus.

The problem is about a cook who bought 4 bags of onions. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. The price per pound is $1.50. The question is how much the cook spent in total.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total weight of all the onions. Since there are 4 bags and each is 50 pounds, I should multiply 4 by 50. Let me do that: 4 times 50 is 200 pounds. So, the total weight is 200 pounds.\n\nNext, the cost per pound is $1.50. To find the total cost, I need to multiply the total weight by the price per pound. That would be 200 pounds times $1.50 per pound. Hmm, 200 times 1.5. Let me break that down. 200 times 1 is 200, and 200 times 0.5 is 100. Adding those together gives 200 + 100 = 300. So, the total cost should be $300.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 1.50 dollars per pound. So, 200 pounds multiplied by 1.5. Alternatively, 1.5 is the same as 3/2. So, 200 times 3/2 is (200/2)*3 = 100*3 = 300. Yep, that's the same result. So, $300 seems right.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here.

I need to figure out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister. The problem says that on Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday. Each cookie has 200 calories. So, I need to calculate the total calories for both Sue and her sister and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information step by step. \n\nStarting with Monday: Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister on Monday, that would be 4 * 5. Let me calculate that: 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. So Sue had 20 cookies on Monday.\n\nThen on Tuesday, the sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many as her sister on Tuesday, so that's 2 * 13. Let me do that math: 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. So Sue had 26 cookies on Tuesday.\n\nNow, I need to find the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days. For Sue, that's Monday's 20 plus Tuesday's 26. Adding those together: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. \n\nFor her sister, it's Monday's 5 plus Tuesday's 13. That's 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.\n\nNext, I need to convert the number of cookies into calories. Each cookie is 200 calories. So Sue's total calories would be 46 cookies * 200 calories per cookie. Let me compute that: 46 * 200. Hmm, 46 * 200 is the same as 46 * 2 * 100, which is 92 * 100 = 9200 calories.\n\nHer sister's total calories are 18 cookies * 200 calories. That's 18 * 200. Again, breaking it down: 10*200=2000, 8*200=1600, so 2000 + 1600 = 3600 calories.\n\nNow, to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, I subtract the sister's total from Sue's total. So 9200 (Sue) - 3600 (sister) = 5600 calories.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nMonday: Sue's sister had 5, Sue had 4*5=20. Tuesday: sister had 13, Sue had 2*13=26. Total for Sue: 20+26=46. Sister: 5+13=18. Calories: 46*200=9200, 18*200=3600. Difference: 9200-3600=5600. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI think that's all.
