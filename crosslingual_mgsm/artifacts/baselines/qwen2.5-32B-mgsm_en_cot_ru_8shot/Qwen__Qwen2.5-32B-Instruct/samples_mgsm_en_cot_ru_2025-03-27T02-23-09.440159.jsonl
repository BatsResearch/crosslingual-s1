Он покупает дом за 80 000 $ и вкладывает 50 000 $ в ремонт. Это повысило стоимость дома на 150 %. Какую выгоду он получил?\n\nШаг за шагом ответ:\n\n1. Сначала определим общую стоимость, которую Джош вложил в дом: 80 000 $ (стоимость дома) + 50 000 $ (ремонт) = 130 000 $.\n2. Ремонт повысил стоимость дома на 150 %. Это означает, что стоимость дома увеличилась на 150% от его первоначальной стоимости (до ремонта). Первичная стоимость дома была 80 000 $, поэтому увеличение стоимости составило 80 000 $ * 150% = 120 000 $.\n3. Таким образом, новая стоимость дома после ремонта составляет 80 000 $ (первоначальная стоимость) + 120 000 $ (увеличение стоимости) = 200 000 $.\n4. Выгода, которую получил Джош, равна разнице между новой стоимостью дома и его общими затратами: 200 000 $ (новая стоимость) - 130 000 $ (общие затраты) = 70 000 $.\n\nОтвет: Джош получил выгоду в размере 70 000 $."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "28713bff79dccacc54d5f560865c39422b153d4a5d5e48399d0b18e4ca9ca5ff", "prompt_hash": "0b276e5134e8398aa727d976f62b7a2e5d006e5354459ae1ebfcab4b4da19794", "target_hash": "265f10e1bf87701b7aa597c197b6a25b0984777f3443a289d7a92aedd31fddcf", "exact_match": 0.0}

Один стакан стоит 5$, но каждый второй стакан стоит всего лишь 60% от цены. Кайлар хочет купить 16 стаканов. Сколько он должен за них заплатить?\nПеревод ответа: Каждый второй стакан стоит 60% от 5$, что составляет 5 * 0.6 = 3$. Всего Кайлар хочет купить 16 стаканов, из которых половина будет по 5$, а другая половина по 3$. То есть, 8 стаканов по 5$ и 8 стаканов по 3$. Стоимость 8 стаканов по 5$ составляет 8 * 5 = 40$. Стоимость 8 стаканов по 3$ составляет 8 * 3 = 24$. Итак, общая стоимость 16 стаканов составляет 40 + 24 = 64$. Ответ: 64$. \n\nStep-by-Step Answer: Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 5 * 0.6 = $3. Kylear wants to buy 16 glasses, half of which will cost $5 each and the other half $3 each. So, 8 glasses at $5 each and 8 glasses at $3 each. The cost of 8 glasses at $5 each is 8 * 5 = $40. The cost of 8 glasses at $3 each is 8 * 3 = $24. Thus, the total cost for 16 glasses is 40 + 24 = $64.

Сначала вычислим, сколько времени Карла тратит на загрузку 40% файла до перезагрузки: 200 ГБ * 40% = 80 ГБ. При скорости загрузки 2 ГБ в минуту, это займет 80 ГБ / 2 ГБ/мин = 40 минут.\n2.

Сколько воды в оставшихся 24 литрах?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Перевод вопроса: У меня есть 10 литров апельсинового напитка, которые на две трети состоят из воды, и я хочу добавить его к 15 литрам ананасового напитка, который на три пятых состоит из воды. Но когда я наливаю, то проливаю один литр апельсинового напитка. Сколько воды в оставшихся 24 литрах?\n\nШаг-за-шагом ответ:\n\n1. Определим количество воды в апельсиновом напитке до пролития. Апельсиновый напиток составляет 10 литров, из которых две трети - это вода. Значит, вода составляет 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 = 6.67 литров.\n\n2. После пролития одного литра апельсинового напитка, количество воды в нем уменьшается. Один литр апельсинового напитка содержит (2/3) литра воды. Таким образом, после пролития, в апельсиновом напитке остается 6.67 - (2/3) = 6.67 - 0.67 = 6 литров воды.\n\n3. Определим количество воды в ананасовом напитке. Ананасовый напиток составляет 15 литров, из которых три пятых - это вода. Значит, вода составляет 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 = 9 литров.\n\n4. Теперь сложим количество воды в оставшемся апельсиновом напитке и ананасовом напитке: 6 + 9 = 15 литров воды.\n\nОтвет: В оставшихся 24 литрах напитков содержится 15 литров воды."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "36cb53615a1006be942a3abc766c8129bfb581c036fdd01068ab03a6027ac7e8", "prompt_hash": "de015e8549e3ecc3250c47a017fe79f7f3902235846e28e75fadba674223a9a5", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

First, we need to determine Dana's running speed. Since she jogs at 3 miles per hour and jogging is half the speed of running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.\n2. Next, we calculate her walking speed. Since running is four times faster than walking, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.\n3. Now, we need to calculate the time spent running and walking. A third of the time is spent running, so she runs for 6 / 3 = 2 hours.

Сначала вычислим общую стоимость телефонов без учета процентов: 5 телефонов * 150 $ = 750 $.\n2. Теперь вычислим годовой процент на общую сумму: 750 $ * 2% = 15 $.\n3.

Each can of tomatoes weighs 16 ounces, so the number of cans used is 64 / 16 = 4 cans.\n3. Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.\n\nThe answer is 12 tomatoes."]], "filtered_resps": ["12"], "doc_hash": "228153a78f71c4e3efdfe3b0902dc69df3ca4c01793ce143b650a89e22c03ca3", "prompt_hash": "d3850236c2538a5f291ef9fb21d895ab4f86a2bbdb73c0b71763e71914e9315d", "target_hash": "6b51d431df5d7f141cbececcf79edf3dd861c3b4069f0b11661a3eefacbba918", "exact_match": 1.0}

Каждая коробка имеет размер 5 дюймов на 6 дюймов на 4 дюйма. Толщина стенок — 1 дюйм. Каков общий внутренний объем всех 3 коробок?\n\nШаг за шагом ответ:\n\n1. Сначала нужно определить внутренние размеры одной коробки, учитывая толщину стенок. Если толщина стенок 1 дюйм, то внутренние размеры будут на 2 дюйма меньше по каждому измерению (1 дюйм с каждой стороны).\n\n2.

Если заработная плата Адриена и Лайлы выросла одновременно, и Адриен зарабатывал 40 000 $ четыре года назад, подсчитайте, сколько они в совокупности зарабатывали вдвоем спустя четыре года?\n\nШаг за шагом ответ:\n\n1. Определим зарплату Лайлы четыре года назад. Если зарплата Адриена была на 30% выше зарплаты Лайлы, то можно выразить зарплату Лайлы через зарплату Адриена. Пусть зарплата Лайлы будет \\(X\\). Тогда зарплата Адриена \\(1.3X = 40000\\). Отсюда \\(X = 40000 / 1.3 = 30769.23\\) долларов.\n\n2. Через четыре года зарплата Адриена увеличилась на 40%. Значит, его зарплата стала \\(40000 * 1.4 = 56000\\) долларов.\n\n3. Предполагается, что зарплата Лайлы также увеличилась на 40%.

There are twice as many worker bees as larvae, and there are twice as many larvae as queens. How many worker bees are there?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer:\nLet's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of larvae as L, and the number of worker bees as W.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following relationships:\n1. W = 2L (there are twice as many worker bees as larvae)\n2. L = 2Q (there are twice as many larvae as queens)\n3. W + L + Q = 700 (the total number of bees)\n\nFrom the second relationship, we can express L as 2Q. Substituting this into the first relationship gives us W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.\n\nNow we can substitute W and L in terms of Q into the third relationship:\n4Q + 2Q + Q = 700\n7Q = 700\nQ = 100\n\nNow that we know there are 100 queens, we can find the number of larvae:\nL = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200\n\nAnd the number of worker bees:\nW = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400\n\nSo, there are 400 worker bees.

Когда чайка приземлилась, она выхватила половину от количества ломтиков картошки, которое съел Дейв. Затем три голубя прогнали ее от еды, и каждый голубь съел три ломтика. После этого енот украл две трети оставшихся ломтиков картошки. Муравьи унесли последний ломтик картошки, оставив пять штук.

Дейв съел 14 ломтиков картошки-фри.\n2. Чайка украла половину от количества, которое съел Дейв, то есть 14 / 2 = 7 ломтиков.\n3. Три голубя съели по 3 ломтика каждый, то есть 3 * 3 = 9 ломтиков.\n4. После этого енот украл две трети оставшихся ломтиков. После голубей осталось 5 ломтиков, значит до енота было 5 + 9 = 14 ломтиков.

Сначала определим, сколько раз цена увеличится за 36 месяцев. Поскольку цена увеличивается каждые два месяца, за 36 месяцев цена увеличится 36 / 2 = 18 раз.\n\n2. Увеличение цены на 20% от первоначальной цены означает, что каждые два месяца цена будет увеличиваться на 20% от 20$, то есть на 4$ (20 * 0.20 = 4).\n\n3. Однако, если мы применим увеличение цены на 20% от первоначальной цены 18 раз, это будет неверно, так как каждый раз увеличение будет применяться к новой, уже увеличенной цене, а не к первоначальной.\n\n4. Правильный способ рассчитать это - использовать формулу сложного процента: новая цена = первоначальная цена * (1 + процентная ставка)^количество периодов.\n\n5. В нашем случае, новая цена = 20 * (1 + 0.20)^18.\n\n6.

Есть 3 фигурки, каждая из которых стоит 5$, поэтому все фигурки стоят 3 * 5 = 15$. Кукла стоит, как 3 фигурки, то есть 3 * 5 = 15$.

Если они получили 25 $ прибыли, сколько они потратили на лимоны?\n\nШаг-за-шаг ответ:\n\n1. Сначала определим, сколько они зарабатывают на каждом галлоне лимонада. Они продают 20 стаканов по 0,50 $ каждый, значит, за галлон они получают 20 * 0,50 = 10 $.\n2.

Издательство Б платит Марку в два раза больше, чем издательство А. Марк редактирует суммарно по 1000 предложений каждую неделю, и издательство А платит ему по 5 центов за предложение.

Марк редактирует 1000 предложений в неделю.\n\nПусть x - количество предложений, редактируемых для издательства А, а y - для издательства Б. Тогда:\nx + y = 1000\n\nПоскольку ставка издательства Б в два раза выше, то выгодно предположить, что Марк редактирует больше предложений для издательства А. Однако, без дополнительной информации о соотношении предложений, редактируемых для каждого издательства, мы не можем точно определить x и y. Но мы можем рассчитать заработок Марка в зависимости от x и y.\n\nЗаработок Марка = 5x + 10y центов\n\nТак как x + y = 1000, то y = 1000 - x.\n\nПодставим это в формулу заработка:\nЗаработок Марка = 5x + 10(1000 - x) = 5x + 10000 - 10x = 10000 - 5x\n\nМаксимальный заработок будет, если Марк редактирует все предложения для издательства Б (x = 0):\n10000 - 5*0 = 10000 центов\n\nМинимальный заработок будет, если Марк редактирует все предложения для издательства А (x = 1000):\n10000 - 5*1000 = 5000 центов\n\nТаким образом, Марк зарабатывает от 5000 до 10000 центов в неделю, в зависимости от количества предложений, редактируемых для каждого издательства."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "91599a27421e47f898b54853b1e28ad92a15d416474f417cb68a01d7e9821ee4", "prompt_hash": "0f1266be7d026b02117d0a8bf42463e1fa15a4d6d2fafe081633dcbffa051a4d", "target_hash": "04d901cdcc744547648b1942b9ecb2ad2b6a4af2a98be503d39cacd3e88da431", "exact_match": 0.0}

Он покупает дом за 80 000 $ и вкладывает 50 000 $ в ремонт. Это повысило стоимость дома на 150 %. Какую выгоду он получил?\n\nШаг за шагом ответ:\n\n1. Сначала определим общую стоимость, которую Джош вложил в дом: 80 000 $ (стоимость дома) + 50 000 $ (ремонт) = 130 000 $.\n2. Ремонт повысил стоимость дома на 150 %. Это означает, что стоимость дома увеличилась на 150% от его первоначальной стоимости (до ремонта). Первичная стоимость дома была 80 000 $, поэтому увеличение стоимости составило 80 000 $ * 150% = 120 000 $.\n3. Таким образом, новая стоимость дома после ремонта составляет 80 000 $ (первоначальная стоимость) + 120 000 $ (увеличение стоимости) = 200 000 $.\n4. Выгода, которую получил Джош, равна разнице между новой стоимостью дома и его общими затратами: 200 000 $ (новая стоимость) - 130 000 $ (общие затраты) = 70 000 $.\n\nОтвет: Джош получил выгоду в размере 70 000 $."]], "filtered_resps": ["$."], "doc_hash": "28713bff79dccacc54d5f560865c39422b153d4a5d5e48399d0b18e4ca9ca5ff", "prompt_hash": "0b276e5134e8398aa727d976f62b7a2e5d006e5354459ae1ebfcab4b4da19794", "target_hash": "265f10e1bf87701b7aa597c197b6a25b0984777f3443a289d7a92aedd31fddcf", "exact_match": 0.0}

Один стакан стоит 5$, но каждый второй стакан стоит всего лишь 60% от цены. Кайлар хочет купить 16 стаканов. Сколько он должен за них заплатить?\nПеревод ответа: Каждый второй стакан стоит 60% от 5$, что составляет 5 * 0.6 = 3$. Всего Кайлар хочет купить 16 стаканов, из которых половина будет по 5$, а другая половина по 3$. То есть, 8 стаканов по 5$ и 8 стаканов по 3$. Стоимость 8 стаканов по 5$ составляет 8 * 5 = 40$. Стоимость 8 стаканов по 3$ составляет 8 * 3 = 24$. Итак, общая стоимость 16 стаканов составляет 40 + 24 = 64$. Ответ: 64$. \n\nStep-by-Step Answer: Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 5 * 0.6 = $3. Kylear wants to buy 16 glasses, half of which will cost $5 each and the other half $3 each. So, 8 glasses at $5 each and 8 glasses at $3 each. The cost of 8 glasses at $5 each is 8 * 5 = $40. The cost of 8 glasses at $3 each is 8 * 3 = $24.

Сначала вычислим, сколько времени Карла тратит на загрузку 40% файла до перезагрузки: 200 ГБ * 40% = 80 ГБ. При скорости загрузки 2 ГБ в минуту, это займет 80 ГБ / 2 ГБ/мин = 40 минут.\n2.

Но когда я наливаю, то проливаю один литр апельсинового напитка. Сколько воды в оставшихся 24 литрах?\n\nШаг-за-шагом ответ:\n\n1. Определим количество воды в апельсиновом напитке до пролития. Апельсиновый напиток составляет 10 литров, из которых две трети - это вода. Значит, вода составляет 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 = 6.67 литров.\n\n2. После пролития одного литра апельсинового напитка, количество воды в нем уменьшается. Один литр апельсинового напитка содержит (2/3) литра воды. Таким образом, после пролития, в апельсиновом напитке остается 6.67 - (2/3) = 6.67 - 0.67 = 6 литров воды.\n\n3. Определим количество воды в ананасовом напитке. Ананасовый напиток составляет 15 литров, из которых три пятых - это вода. Значит, вода составляет 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 = 9 литров.\n\n4. Теперь сложим количество воды в оставшемся апельсиновом напитке и ананасовом напитке: 6 + 9 = 15 литров воды.\n\nОтвет: В оставшихся 24 литрах напитков содержится 15 литров воды."]], "filtered_resps": ["15"], "doc_hash": "36cb53615a1006be942a3abc766c8129bfb581c036fdd01068ab03a6027ac7e8", "prompt_hash": "de015e8549e3ecc3250c47a017fe79f7f3902235846e28e75fadba674223a9a5", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 1.0}

Сначала вычислим общую стоимость телефонов без учета процентов: 5 телефонов * 150 $ = 750 $.\n2. Теперь вычислим годовой процент на общую сумму: 750 $ * 2% = 15 $.\n3.

Если в одном пакете собачьего корма содержится 110 чашек, сколько пакетов собачьего корма Сесилия израсходует за первый год?\n\nШаг-за-шаг ответ:\n\n1. За первые 180 дней Сесилия будет кормить щенка 1 чашкой в день, значит, за 180 дней щенок съест 180 * 1 = 180 чашек корма.\n2. В году 365 дней, значит, после первых 180 дней останется 365 - 180 = 185 дней.\n3. За оставшиеся 185 дней Сесилия будет кормить щенка 2 чашками в день, значит, за 185 дней щенок съест 185 * 2 = 370 чашек корма.\n4. Всего за год щенок съест 180 + 370 = 550 чашек корма.\n5.

In each 16-ounce can of tomatoes that she uses, there are three tomatoes. The weight of the last portion of tomato sauce prepared by Frida was 32 ounces. How many tomatoes did Frida use?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer:\n1. The sauce weighs 32 ounces, but since the tomatoes lose half their volume during cooking, the original weight of the tomatoes before cooking was twice that, so 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.\n2. Each can of tomatoes weighs 16 ounces, so the number of cans used is 64 / 16 = 4 cans.\n3.

Каждая коробка имеет размер 5 дюймов на 6 дюймов на 4 дюйма. Толщина стенок — 1 дюйм. Каков общий внутренний объем всех 3 коробок?\n\nШаг за шагом ответ:\n\n1. Сначала нужно определить внутренние размеры одной коробки, учитывая толщину стенок. Если толщина стенок 1 дюйм, то внутренние размеры будут на 2 дюйма меньше по каждому измерению (1 дюйм с каждой стороны).\n\n2. Внутренние размеры одной коробки:\n   - Длина: 5 дюймов - 2 дюйма = 3 дюйма\n   - Ширина: 6 дюймов - 2 дюйма = 4 дюйма\n   - Высота: 4 дюйма - 2 дюйма = 2 дюйма\n\n3.

Если заработная плата Адриена и Лайлы выросла одновременно, и Адриен зарабатывал 40 000 $ четыре года назад, подсчитайте, сколько они в совокупности зарабатывали вдвоем спустя четыре года?\n\nШаг за шагом ответ:\n\n1. Определим зарплату Лайлы четыре года назад. Если зарплата Адриена была на 30% выше зарплаты Лайлы, то можно выразить зарплату Лайлы через зарплату Адриена. Пусть зарплата Лайлы будет \\(X\\). Тогда зарплата Адриена \\(1.3X = 40000\\). Отсюда \\(X = 40000 / 1.3 = 30769.23\\) долларов.\n\n2. Через четыре года зарплата Адриена увеличилась на 40%. Значит, его зарплата стала \\(40000 * 1.4 = 56000\\) долларов.\n\n3. Предполагается, что зарплата Лайлы также увеличилась на 40%. Значит, ее зарплата стала \\(30769.23 * 1.4 = 43076.92\\) долларов.\n\n4.

There are twice as many worker bees as larvae, and there are twice as many larvae as queens. How many worker bees are there?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer:\nLet's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of larvae as L, and the number of worker bees as W.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following relationships:\n1. W = 2L (there are twice as many worker bees as larvae)\n2. L = 2Q (there are twice as many larvae as queens)\n3. W + L + Q = 700 (the total number of bees)\n\nFrom the second relationship, we can express L as 2Q. Substituting this into the first relationship gives us W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.\n\nNow we can substitute W and L in terms of Q into the third relationship:\n4Q + 2Q + Q = 700\n7Q = 700\nQ = 100\n\nNow that we know there are 100 queens, we can find the number of larvae:\nL = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200\n\nAnd the number of worker bees:\nW = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400\n\nSo, there are 400 worker bees.

Сначала определим, сколько раз цена увеличится за 36 месяцев. Поскольку цена увеличивается каждые два месяца, за 36 месяцев цена увеличится 36 / 2 = 18 раз.\n\n2. Увеличение цены на 20% от первоначальной цены означает, что каждые два месяца цена будет увеличиваться на 20% от 20$, то есть на 4$ (20 * 0.20 = 4).\n\n3. Однако, если мы применим увеличение цены на 20% от первоначальной цены 18 раз, это будет неверно, так как каждый раз увеличение будет применяться к новой, уже увеличенной цене, а не к первоначальной.\n\n4. Правильный способ рассчитать это - использовать формулу сложного процента: новая цена = первоначальная цена * (1 + процентная ставка)^количество периодов.\n\n5. В нашем случае, новая цена = 20 * (1 + 0.20)^18.\n\n6.

Они продают 20 стаканов по 0,50 $ каждый, значит, за галлон они получают 20 * 0,50 = 10 $.\n2. Стоимость приготовления одного галлона лимонада составляет 3 $ на лимоны и 2 $ на сахар, то есть 5 $ на галлон.\n3. Прибыль с одного галлона лимонада составляет 10 $ - 5 $ = 5 $.\n4.
