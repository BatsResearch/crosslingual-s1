Calculate the new salary for Edwina after the increase.\n4. Calculate the new salary for Lila after the increase.\n5. Sum the new salaries of Edwina and Lila to get the total.\n\nStep 1: Initial difference in salaries\nThe difference in salaries is 30% of Lila's salary. Let's denote Lila's salary as \\( L \\).

If her initial salary was \\( E \\), then her new salary after four years is \\( E + 0.40E = 1.40E \\).\n\nStep 3: New salary for Edwina\nWe know that Edwina's initial salary \\( E \\) was $40,000.

However, if we assume Lila's initial salary \\( L \\) is known, we can substitute it into the equation to find the total.\n\nFor example, if Lila's initial salary \\( L \\) was $30,000, then:\n\\[ 56,000 + 1.30 \\times 30,000 = 56,000 + 39,000 = 95,000 \\]\n\nSo, the total salary for both Edwina and Lila after four years would be $95,000."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "2b7bfaa98a91c9deb679713cee49aef5dab132fee8a4cb0c121730ed98a1119c", "prompt_hash": "18b283df46451e8b434f338c74a6436e98d1ebdb2f0b6a434d18bacbe3dd4648", "target_hash": "c3dd3155bfb41ce88db8cb3949533694746fe2767aeea3faba904b50baabfca6", "exact_match": 0.0}
