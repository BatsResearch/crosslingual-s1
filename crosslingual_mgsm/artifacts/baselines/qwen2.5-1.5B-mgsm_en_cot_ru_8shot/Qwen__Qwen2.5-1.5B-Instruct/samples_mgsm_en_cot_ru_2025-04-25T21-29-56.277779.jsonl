Если Ли пробегает 400 метров с препятствиями за 38 секунд, за сколько секунд Джеральд может пробежать 400 метров с препятствиями с учетом его улучшенной диеты?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Speed Comparison:**\n   - Let \\( L \\) be the initial speed of Li.\n   - Let \\( J \\) be the initial speed of Gerald.\n   - According to the problem, \\( L = J + 2 \\) (Li is 2 seconds faster than Gerald).\n\n2. **Speed Increase:**\n   - Gerald's speed increased by 10%, so his new speed is \\( J + 0.1J = 1.1J \\).\n\n3. **Time Calculation for Li:**\n   - Li's time to run 400 meters with obstacles is 38 seconds.\n   - Time = Distance / Speed\n   - \\( 38 = \\frac{400}{L} \\)\n   - Solving for \\( L \\):\n     \\[\n     L = \\frac{400}{38} \\approx 10.53 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Time Calculation for Gerald:**\n   - Gerald's new speed is \\( 1.1J \\).\n   - Using the same distance (400 meters):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{400}{1.1J}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Substitute \\( L \\) into the equation:**\n   - We know \\( L = J + 2 \\), so \\( J = L - 2 \\).\n   - Substitute \\( J \\) in the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{400}{1.1(L - 2)}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the equation:**\n   - We need to find the time \\( T \\) for Gerald:\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{400}{1.1(L - 2)}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Using the relationship \\( L = J + 2 \\):**\n   - Since \\( L = J + 2 \\), we can express \\( J \\) in terms of \\( L \\):\n     \\[\n     J = L - 2\n     \\]\n\n8. **Substitute \\( J \\) back into the equation:**\n   - We need to find \\( T \\) in terms of \\( L \\):\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{400}{1.1(L - 2)}\n     \\]\n\n9. **Simplify further:**\n   - Since \\( L = J + 2 \\), we can simplify the expression:\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{400}{1.1(L - 2)} = \\frac{400}{1.1L - 2.2}\n     \\]\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**\n    - We know \\( L = 10.53 \\) seconds, so:\n      \\[\n      T = \\frac{400}{1.1 \\times 10.53 - 2.2} \\approx \\frac{400}{11.583 - 2.2} \\approx \\frac{400}{9.383} \\approx 42.6 \\text{ seconds}\n      \\]\n\nTherefore, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 42.6 seconds with his improved diet."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "18e87e0fe39b91ede545c6b8987de6e4026e82a18f75e0c99f9a6d9de6de4e8e", "prompt_hash": "4a9721a7da33ea9f3d5bea434e1f771521800ae1fcd726093d2503d453f765a4", "target_hash": "76a50887d8f1c2e9301755428990ad81479ee21c25b43215cf524541e0503269", "exact_match": 0.0}

Сейчас в большом бассейне в четыре раза больше воды, чем в маленьком бассейне. Сколько сейчас воды в маленьком бассейне?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Let's denote the volume of water in the small pool as \\( x \\) gallons. Since the large pool has twice the volume of the small pool, its volume is \\( 2x \\) gallons.\n\nThe small pool loses water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so in 4 minutes, it loses \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) gallons. Therefore, the volume of water in the small pool after 4 minutes is \\( x - 16 \\) gallons.\n\nThe large pool loses water at the same rate, so in 4 minutes, it loses \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) gallons. Therefore, the volume of water in the large pool after 4 minutes is \\( 2x - 16 \\) gallons.\n\nAccording to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
