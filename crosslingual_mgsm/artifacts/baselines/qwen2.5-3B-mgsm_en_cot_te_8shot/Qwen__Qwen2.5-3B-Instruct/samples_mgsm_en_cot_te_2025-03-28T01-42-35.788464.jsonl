If Remya reduces the dust by a certain amount, the police will catch 4 more people.\n2. If Remya reduces the dust by 400 pounds, the police will catch 4 more people.\n3. We need to find out how many people Remya and Devi will catch together if she reduces the dust by a certain amount.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can infer that reducing the dust by 400 pounds results in catching 4 more people. This means that reducing the dust by 100 pounds would result in catching 1 more person (since 400 pounds is 4 times 100 pounds).\n\nNow, let's assume that reducing the dust by a certain amount \\( x \\) pounds results in catching \\( y \\) more people. From the given information, we know that:\n\n- Reducing by 400 pounds (\\( x = 400 \\)) results in catching 4 more people (\\( y = 4 \\)).\n- Reducing by 100 pounds (\\( x = 100 \\)) results in catching 1 more person (\\( y = 1 \\)).\n\nFrom this, we can see that the number of people caught is directly proportional to the amount of dust reduced. Therefore, if Remya reduces the dust by \\( x \\) pounds, she will catch \\( \\frac{x}{100} \\) more people.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where Remya reduces the dust by a certain amount \\( x \\) pounds. The police will catch \\( \\frac{x}{100} \\) more people. Since we don't have a specific value for \\( x \\), we can't determine the exact number of people caught. However, we can express the number of people caught in terms of \\( x \\).\n\nIf we assume the reduction in dust is \\( x \\) pounds, then the number of people caught will be \\( \\frac{x}{100} \\).\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of people caught by Remya and Devi together, and we don't have specific information about Devi's contribution, we can only express the answer in terms of \\( x \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of people caught by Remya and Devi together if Remya reduces the dust by \\( x \\) pounds is \\( \\frac{x}{100} \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{x}{100}}\n\\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "6839c6f777723c2947fbfca7d62835e3eb5934da67cad22d822a1b78c8a94347", "prompt_hash": "1b28e62f4cb515e7b61f727205e12927e5afe2e24a35e42636bf217040907df6", "target_hash": "ad57366865126e55649ecb23ae1d48887544976efea46a48eb5d85a6eeb4d306", "exact_match": 0.0}

However, if we assume the problem is asking for the percentage based on the given information without specifying \\( x \\), we can infer that the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{x}{36 + x} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWithout the exact value of \\( x \\), we cannot simplify this further. But if we assume \\( x \\) is a value that fits within the context of the problem, we can calculate it. For example, if \\( x = 4 \\) (as a hypothetical scenario), then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{4}{36 + 4} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{4}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 10\\% \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10\\%} \\]\n\nThis is the percentage based on the hypothetical scenario where there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

Since the tank had 24 liters on Monday, we need to calculate how much water is added:\n\n- For every 10 liters, 2 liters are added.\n- 24 liters / 10 = 2.4, which means 2 full sets of 10 liters (4 liters) and an additional 0.4 of a set of 10 liters (0.8 liters).\n\nSo, the police add 2 + 0.8 = 2.8 liters of water.\n\nAdding this to the 24 liters already in the tank, we get:\n24 + 2.8 = 26.8 liters.\n\nTherefore, on Tuesday (బుధవారం), the tank in the tank has 26.8 liters of water."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "09635d0dfb98a61eceaa05dfc71372c5bcabcb07dc06ee8a00e0c9c2ad5a0360", "prompt_hash": "a4b56b3dfd4972f770d2206a51831021dc9985d1365a1504498e968cd402f9ae", "target_hash": "b17ef6d19c7a5b1ee83b907c595526dcb1eb06db8227d650d5dda0a9f4ce8cd9", "exact_match": 0.0}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of buses sold.\n\n2. **Calculate Revenue from Selling Buses:**\n   - Each bus is sold for $30.\n   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling \\( x \\) buses is \\( 30x \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate Cost of Purchasing Buses:**\n   - The cost to purchase each bus is $2.\n   - Therefore, the total cost to purchase \\( x \\) buses is \\( 2x \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Calculate Profit:**\n   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.\n   - According to the problem, the profit is $400.\n   - Therefore, the equation for profit is:\n     \\[\n     30x - 2x = 400\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - Combine like terms:\n     \\[\n     28x = 400\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 28:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{400}{28} = \\frac{100}{7} \\approx 14.2857\n     \\]\n\nSince the number of buses sold must be a whole number, we need to check if 14 or 15 buses would fit the given conditions.\n\n7. **Check for 14 Buses:**\n   - If \\( x = 14 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revenue} = 30 \\times 14 = 420 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost} = 2 \\times 14 = 28 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit} = 420 - 28 = 392 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - The profit of $392 is less than $400, so 14 buses are not enough.\n\n8. **Check for 15 Buses:**\n   - If \\( x = 15 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revenue} = 30 \\times 15 = 450 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost} = 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit} = 450 - 30 = 420 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - The profit of $420 is more than $400, so 15 buses are more than enough.\n\nSince 14 buses result in a profit of $392, which is less than $400, and 15 buses result in a profit of $420, which is more than $400, the number of buses sold must be 15.\n\nTherefore, the number of buses sold is \\(\\boxed{15}\\)."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "5f4aaa010c21c15c531d2aace7d431c005e64f75a22b3baf1bd92c4adb5247ab", "prompt_hash": "f87a5188070390045c1b1fa6f8d8686982c8f316937979c7554767d6437f34bd", "target_hash": "1a6562590ef19d1045d06c4055742d38288e9e6dcd71ccde5cee80f1d5a774eb", "exact_match": 0.0}

Therefore, no chettis are left at the end of 10 years.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of chettis that are sold after the 30% discount\n- Since all chettis are sold before the 10 years, the 30% discount does not apply.\n- Therefore, the number of chettis sold after the discount is 0.\n\n### Final Answer\nSince all chettis are sold before the 10 years, the number of chettis that are left is 0. \n\nSo, the answer is 0 chettis."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "40c2754c1f62fe6b8af4278fbbf2802fc808dd1e8fef807ea103f8d3961ba06f", "prompt_hash": "2ad67f2aa6256f3360897325d3377c967e6da2f497ea02e975208883015fce1f", "target_hash": "1da51b8d8ff98f6a48f80ae79fe3ca6c26e1abb7b7d125259255d6d2b875ea08", "exact_match": 0.0}

We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert.\n2. We also know that Jean has 54 candies.\n\nLet's denote the number of candies Robert has as \\( R \\). According to the first piece of information, James has \\( R + 6 \\) candies.\n\nSince Jean has 54 candies, and we don't have any direct information about the relationship between Jean and Robert or James, we can infer that the question is asking about the difference in candies between James and Jean.\n\nSo, the number of candies James has is \\( R + 6 \\), and Jean has 54 candies.

We need to find out how many people Remya and Devi will catch together if she reduces the dust by a certain amount.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can infer that reducing the dust by 400 pounds results in catching 4 more people.

However, since the total number of scouts is 200, we can infer that the fractions must sum to 1 (or a whole number close to it).\n\n5. **Re-evaluate the fractions**:\n   - Let's assume the fractions are correct and solve for the number of girls directly:\n   - Number of girls = Total scouts - Number of boys\n   - Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120\n\nTherefore, the number of girls (balikulu) in the Grade 5 scouts is 120."]], "filtered_resps": ["120."], "doc_hash": "946d3247bb3b507289178eb90ff415afd6da17bc5acb87c1bfb90a6784144cb1", "prompt_hash": "0018e5736fab0bd3e5adb8585bfbe9b815b150e4822b044962388c9cf52e1bd2", "target_hash": "d59eced1ded07f84c145592f65bdf854358e009c5cd705f5215bf18697fed103", "exact_match": 0.0}

Initially, there are 1000-పీస్ జిగ్‌సా పజిల్‌ (1000-పీస్ జిగ్‌సా పజిల్‌) in the parking lot.\n2. 2 more cars arrive, so the total number of cars becomes 1000-పీస్ జిగ్‌సా పజిల్‌ + 2.\n3. Among these, 3 cars are parked on the board, and the remaining cars are parked in the slots that are not occupied by the board cars.\n\nSince we know there are 3 cars on the board, the number of cars that are not on the board (and thus not occupied by the board cars) is the total number of cars minus the 3 cars on the board.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of cars after the 2 more cars arrive:\n\nTotal cars = 1000-పీస్ జిగ్‌సా పజిల్‌ + 2\n\nNow, subtract the 3 cars on the board from the total number of cars to find the number of cars that are not on the board:\n\nCars not on the board = Total cars - Cars on the board\nCars not on the board = (1000-పీస్ జిగ్‌సా పజిల్‌ + 2) - 3\n\nSimplifying this:\n\nCars not on the board = 1000-పీస్ జిగ్‌సా పజిల్‌ - 1\n\nSince 1000-పీస్ జిగ్‌సా పజిల్‌ is the initial number of cars, and we are not given the exact number, we can conclude that the number of cars not on the board is 1 less than the initial number of cars.\n\nTherefore, the number of cars that are not on the board (and thus not occupied by the board cars) is 1 less than the initial number of cars, which is 1000-పీస్ జిగ్‌సా పజిల్‌ - 1.\n\nGiven the context, if we assume 1000-పీస్ జిగ్‌సా పజిల్‌ is 1000 (as it's a common number of cars), then the number of cars not on the board would be:\n\n1000 - 1 = 999\n\nSo, there are 999 cars that are not on the board, meaning 999 cars are not occupied by the board cars."]], "filtered_resps": ["999"], "doc_hash": "0f825514f62bcd355722c3ee61d582062b53ae6cd68e0996a724e66c869068f3", "prompt_hash": "ae67d230f6c3d75d376d5c6932b286d6036f402fd98d1c2ae0c23877f3b70511", "target_hash": "0604cd3138feed202ef293e062da2f4720f77a05d25ee036a7a01c9cfcdd1f0a", "exact_match": 0.0}

After buying the new packs, the total number of spoons is 12.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of spoons after buying the new packs:\n- Initially, there were 5 packs.\n- Then, 5 more packs were bought, making it 5 + 5 = 10 packs.\n- Each pack contains the same number of spoons, and we know the total number of spoons is 12.\n\nSince there are 10 packs and 12 spoons in total, each pack must contain:\n\\[ \\frac{12 \\text{ spoons}}{10 \\text{ packs}} = 1.2 \\text{ spoons per pack} \\]\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with whole spoons, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Given that the total number of spoons is 12 and there are 10 packs, it implies that each pack contains 1.2 spoons, which is not practical for real spoons. \n\nBut if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find out how many spoons were in the packs Julie bought, we can calculate it as follows:\n\nJulie bought 5 packs, and the total number of spoons is 12. So, the number of spoons in the 5 packs she bought is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ spoons} - (5 \\text{ packs} \\times 1 \\text{ spoon per pack}) = 12 - 5 = 7 \\text{ spoons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the 5 packs Julie bought contained 7 spoons in total.
