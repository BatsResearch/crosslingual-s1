Since the final mixture is 10 liters of orange juice and 15 liters of pineapple juice, the 24 liters remaining contain 2 liters of water and 22 liters of the final mixture.\n\nThe answer is that there are 2 liters of water in the 24 liters remaining."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "176cd5a966084c7cd27877e7ac332b29ca75e9b453378296d4c8984612205ef6", "prompt_hash": "4474842167dc476d1626e64fd8f78aac04f38d771bbcd823185b8dc640ce7ec2", "target_hash": "e629fa6598d732768f7c726b4b621285f9c3b85303900aa912017db7617d8bdb", "exact_match": 0.0}

The top layer has 6 fruits.\n2. The bottom layer has 67 fruits.\n3. Therefore, the total number of fruits in one basket is 6 + 67 = 73 fruits.\n\nNow, we know there are 20 pieces of fruit in total. To find out how many baskets can be filled with these fruits, we divide the total number of fruits by the number of fruits per basket:\n\n20 ÷ 73 = 0.273...\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a basket, and there are only 20 pieces of fruit, we can only fill 0 full baskets with these fruits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0 baskets."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "cee0c2f4519e19dd00d2277affff0173c6ef52b1e84930a8e12d6ae2cab21cd2", "prompt_hash": "1dc451769f48465f5c38436ccbb3faf628e323b09ba1618048ba0fafa5813d13", "target_hash": "38b2d03f3256502b1e9db02b2d12aa27a46033ffe6d8c0ef0f2cf6b1530be9d8", "exact_match": 0.0}

If Remya reduces the dust by a certain amount, the police will catch 4 more people.\n2. If Remya reduces the dust by 400 pounds, the police will catch 4 more people.\n3. We need to find out how many more people the police will catch if Remya reduces the dust by a certain amount.\n\nFrom the information given, we can infer that reducing the dust by 400 pounds results in the police catching 4 more people. This suggests a linear relationship between the reduction in dust and the number of people caught by the police.\n\nLet's denote:\n- The reduction in dust by \\( x \\) pounds.\n- The number of people caught by the police as \\( y \\).\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n- When \\( x = 400 \\) pounds, \\( y = 4 \\) people.\n\nWe can assume the relationship is linear, so we can write the equation as:\n\\[ y = kx + c \\]\n\nUsing the given values:\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 400 + c \\]\n\nSince we don't have another specific point, we can assume that the relationship is directly proportional (i.e., \\( c = 0 \\)) for simplicity. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[ y = \\frac{k}{400} x \\]\n\nUsing the given point:\n\\[ 4 = \\frac{k}{400} \\cdot 400 \\]\n\\[ 4 = k \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ y = x \\]\n\nThis means that for every pound of dust reduced, the police will catch 1 more person.\n\nNow, if Remya reduces the dust by a certain amount \\( x \\) pounds, the police will catch \\( x \\) more people.\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of people caught, and we know that reducing the dust by 400 pounds results in catching 4 more people, we can generalize that reducing the dust by \\( x \\) pounds will result in catching \\( x \\) more people.\n\nTherefore, if Remya reduces the dust by a certain amount, the police will catch that many more people.

However, if we assume that the number of semi-automatic cars is part of the total count and we are looking for a general expression, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{x}{36 + x} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWithout the specific value of \\( x \\), we cannot simplify this further. If we assume \\( x \\) is a known value, we can substitute it into the formula to get the exact percentage.\n\nFor example, if there were 4 semi-automatic cars (\\( x = 4 \\)):\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{4}{36 + 4} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{4}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 10\\% \\]\n\nSo, if \\( x = 4 \\), the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 10%. \n\nIf you have the specific number of semi-automatic cars, you can substitute that value into the formula to get the exact percentage."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "6c1dafb51b22ff11f8ca36b1c8230e882e0d7a882622e4ae0b47f064915281f0", "prompt_hash": "d0ca7ad9a9c21b204c3c0070b2f6ddd669b1c6509c0979f61de75f4820b1bac6", "target_hash": "f5ca38f748a1d6eaf726b8a42fb575c3c71f1864a8143301782de13da2d9202b", "exact_match": 0.0}

Therefore, in Ethan:\n\\[ 8 = x \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} \\]\n\nIn Jimmie:\n\\[ 10 = x \\times \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} \\]\n\nSince the price per unit \\( x \\) is the same, we can set up the following proportion:\n\\[ \\frac{8}{x} = \\frac{10}{x} \\]\n\nThis implies that the number of units in Jimmie is:\n\\[ \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} = \\frac{10}{8} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} \\]\n\nHowever, we don't need to calculate the exact number of units in Ethan to find the number of units in Jimmie. We can directly use the cost relationship:\n\\[ \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} = \\frac{10}{8} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} \\]\n\nSince the cost per unit is the same, the number of units in Jimmie will be:\n\\[ \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} = \\frac{10}{8} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} = \\frac{5}{4} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} \\]\n\nGiven that the cost in Ethan is $8 for a certain number of units, and the cost in Jimmie is $10 for the same number of units, the number of units in Jimmie will be:\n\\[ \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} = \\frac{10}{8} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} = \\frac{5}{4} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} \\]\n\nSince the cost per unit is the same, the number of units in Jimmie will be:\n\\[ \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} = \\frac{10}{8} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} = \\frac{5}{4} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of units of water in Jimmie is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "90eee518a6eeb09f79e62b6112243864e99a0ddb55fed0c3f6646d3740f45361", "prompt_hash": "8e482286779e87abad4ba21452c0986b1fa14359c4e115ada6a633a1cd02bf8c", "target_hash": "4ec9599fc203d176a301536c2e091a19bc852759b255bd6818810a42c5fed14a", "exact_match": 0.0}

The age difference between Red Gram and Telugu Telu is three years. The age difference between Telugu For and Telugu Red is one year. Telugu For and Telugu Telu are the same age, and Telugu Telu is 8 years older than Telugu For. What is the total age of the four families?\"\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Let's denote the age of Telugu For as \\( T_F \\).\n2. The age of Telugu Telu is \\( T_T = T_F + 8 \\) (since Telugu Telu is 8 years older than Telugu For).\n3. The age difference between Telugu For and Red Gram is 3 years, so if Red Gram's age is \\( R_G \\), then \\( T_F - R_G = 3 \\) or \\( R_G = T_F - 3 \\).\n4. The age difference between Telugu Telu and Red Gram is 3 years, so if Red Gram's age is \\( R_G \\), then \\( T_T - R_G = 3 \\) or \\( T_F + 8 - R_G = 3 \\). Since \\( R_G = T_F - 3 \\), we can substitute and verify: \\( T_F + 8 - (T_F - 3) = 3 \\), which simplifies to \\( 11 = 3 \\), which is incorrect. This indicates a need to re-evaluate the relationships.\n\nGiven the relationships, let's assume Telugu For is \\( T_F \\) years old. Then Telugu Telu is \\( T_F + 8 \\) years old. Since Telugu For and Red Gram have a 3-year difference, Red Gram is \\( T_F - 3 \\) years old.

If Remya reduces the dust by a certain amount, the police will catch 4 more people.\n2. If Remya reduces the dust by 400 pounds, the police will catch 4 more people.\n3. We need to find out how many more people the police will catch if Remya reduces the dust by a certain amount.\n\nFrom the information given, we can infer that reducing the dust by 400 pounds results in the police catching 4 more people. This suggests a linear relationship between the reduction in dust and the number of people caught by the police.\n\nLet's denote:\n- The reduction in dust by \\( x \\) pounds.\n- The number of people caught by the police as \\( y \\).\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n- When \\( x = 400 \\) pounds, \\( y = 4 \\) people.\n\nWe can assume the relationship is linear, so we can write the equation as:\n\\[ y = kx + c \\]\n\nUsing the given values:\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 400 + c \\]\n\nSince we don't have another specific point, we can assume that the relationship is directly proportional (i.e., \\( c = 0 \\)) for simplicity. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[ y = \\frac{k}{400} x \\]\n\nUsing the given point:\n\\[ 4 = \\frac{k}{400} \\cdot 400 \\]\n\\[ 4 = k \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ y = x \\]\n\nThis means that for every pound of dust reduced, the police will catch 1 more person.\n\nNow, if Remya reduces the dust by a certain amount \\( x \\) pounds, the police will catch \\( x \\) more people.\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of people caught, and we know that reducing the dust by 400 pounds results in catching 4 more people, we can generalize that reducing the dust by \\( x \\) pounds will result in catching \\( x \\) more people.\n\nTherefore, if Remya reduces the dust by a certain amount, the police will catch that many more people.

However, assuming the problem intends for us to work with whole numbers, we can round \\( P \\) to the nearest whole number, which is 233.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of koolie tennies:**\n   - If \\( P = 233 \\), then the number of koolie tennies is \\( 2P = 2 \\times 233 = 466 \\).\n\n6. **Verify the total:**\n   - Total tennies: \\( 233 + 466 = 699 \\).\n\nGiven the total is 700, and we rounded down to 233, we need to adjust slightly. If we consider 234 pill tennies, then:\n   - Number of koolie tennies: \\( 2 \\times 234 = 468 \\).\n   - Total tennies: \\( 234 + 468 = 702 \\).\n\nSince 702 is slightly more than 700, we need to adjust back to 233 pill tennies and 466 koolie tennies, which totals 699.\n\nTherefore, the closest and most logical answer based on the given context is:\n\nThe number of koolie tennies is 466.\n\nSo, the number of koolie tennies in the garden is 466."]], "filtered_resps": ["466."], "doc_hash": "98ab8b8271fa550c3f146a418e0f3b86fa2717982d6aa075eedef4c911af7300", "prompt_hash": "aaf9935217121991d860f0d288469fead2055c41deb85e6cf0640da75f28fc55", "target_hash": "26d228663f13a88592a12d16cf9587caab0388b262d6d9f126ed62f9333aca94", "exact_match": 0.0}

Therefore, in Ethan:\n\\[ 8 = x \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} \\]\n\nIn Jimmie:\n\\[ 10 = x \\times \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} \\]\n\nSince the price per unit \\( x \\) is the same, we can set up the following proportion:\n\\[ \\frac{8}{x} = \\frac{10}{x} \\]\n\nThis implies that the number of units in Jimmie is:\n\\[ \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} = \\frac{10}{8} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} \\]\n\nHowever, we don't need to calculate the exact number of units in Ethan to find the number of units in Jimmie. We can directly use the cost relationship:\n\\[ \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} = \\frac{10}{8} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} \\]\n\nSince the cost per unit is the same, the number of units in Jimmie will be:\n\\[ \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} = \\frac{10}{8} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} = \\frac{5}{4} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} \\]\n\nGiven that the cost in Ethan is $8 for a certain number of units, and the cost in Jimmie is $10 for the same number of units, the number of units in Jimmie will be:\n\\[ \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} = \\frac{10}{8} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} = \\frac{5}{4} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} \\]\n\nSince the cost per unit is the same, the number of units in Jimmie will be:\n\\[ \\text{(number of units in Jimmie)} = \\frac{10}{8} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} = \\frac{5}{4} \\times \\text{(number of units in Ethan)} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of units of water in Jimmie is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["5"], "doc_hash": "90eee518a6eeb09f79e62b6112243864e99a0ddb55fed0c3f6646d3740f45361", "prompt_hash": "8e482286779e87abad4ba21452c0986b1fa14359c4e115ada6a633a1cd02bf8c", "target_hash": "4ec9599fc203d176a301536c2e091a19bc852759b255bd6818810a42c5fed14a", "exact_match": 0.0}

The age difference between Red Gram and Telugu Telu is three years. The age difference between Telugu For and Telugu Red is one year. Telugu For and Telugu Telu are the same age, and Telugu Telu is 8 years older than Telugu For. What is the total age of the four families?\"\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Let's denote the age of Telugu For as \\( T_F \\).\n2. The age of Telugu Telu is \\( T_T = T_F + 8 \\) (since Telugu Telu is 8 years older than Telugu For).\n3. The age difference between Telugu For and Red Gram is 3 years, so if Red Gram's age is \\( R_G \\), then \\( T_F - R_G = 3 \\) or \\( R_G = T_F - 3 \\).\n4. The age difference between Telugu Telu and Red Gram is 3 years, so if Red Gram's age is \\( R_G \\), then \\( T_T - R_G = 3 \\) or \\( T_F + 8 - R_G = 3 \\). Since \\( R_G = T_F - 3 \\), we can substitute and verify: \\( T_F + 8 - (T_F - 3) = 3 \\), which simplifies to \\( 11 = 3 \\), which is incorrect. This indicates a need to re-evaluate the relationships.\n\nGiven the relationships, let's assume Telugu For is \\( T_F \\) years old. Then Telugu Telu is \\( T_F + 8 \\) years old. Since Telugu For and Red Gram have a 3-year difference, Red Gram is \\( T_F - 3 \\) years old.
