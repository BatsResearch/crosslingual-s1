The total number of games played is 22, so \\( W + L = 22 \\).\n2. The team won 8 more games than it lost, so \\( W = L + 8 \\).\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \\( L \\):\n\\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \\]\n\\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \\]\n\\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \\]\n\\[ 2L = 14 \\]\n\\[ L = 7 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( L = 7 \\), we can find \\( W \\) using the second equation:\n\\[ W = L + 8 \\]\n\\[ W = 7 + 8 \\]\n\\[ W = 15 \\]\n\nSo, the team won 15 games.

Si el salario de Adrien era un 30% más alto que el de Lylah, podemos establecer la siguiente relación:\n\nSalario de Adrien = Salario de Lylah * 1.30\n\nDado que el salario de Adrien hace cuatro años era de $40,000, podemos resolver para el salario de Lylah:\n\n$40,000 = Salario de Lylah * 1.30\nSalario de Lylah = $40,000 / 1.30\nSalario de Lylah = $30,769.23 (aproximadamente)\n\nAhora, sabemos que el salario de Adrien aumentó un 40% en los últimos cuatro años. Por lo tanto, el nuevo salario de Adrien es:\n\nNuevo salario de Adrien = $40,000 * 1.40\nNuevo salario de Adrien = $56,000\n\nComo el salario de Lylah también aumentó a la par, su salario también aumentó un 40%. Por lo tanto, el nuevo salario de Lylah es:\n\nNuevo salario de Lylah = $30,769.23 * 1.40\nNuevo salario de Lylah = $43,076.92 (aproximadamente)\n\nFinalmente, para calcular el salario total que los dos recibieron cuatro años después, sumamos sus salarios:\n\nSalario total = Nuevo salario de Adrien + Nuevo salario de Lylah\nSalario total = $56,000 + $43,076.92\nSalario total = $99,076.92 (aproximadamente)\n\nPor lo tanto, el salario total que Adrien y Lylah recibieron cuatro años después es de aproximadamente $99,076.92."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "5a4402c2a54b333157708edfb92b03ad723cbb94305b961fe8a17ed0c2dd9226", "prompt_hash": "7f94d04da1a2d7c5d32a2f60cfb4d084743dce032c9ec0814b177eef0b958830", "target_hash": "c3dd3155bfb41ce88db8cb3949533694746fe2767aeea3faba904b50baabfca6", "exact_match": 0.0}

Four minutes ago, the big pool had the same amount of water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times the amount of water in the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?\n\nAhora, vamos a resolver el problema paso a paso:\n\n1. Hace 4 minutos, la piscina grande tenía la misma cantidad de agua que la piscina pequeña. Dado que ambas piscinas están perdiendo agua a una tasa de 4 galones por minuto, en 4 minutos, cada piscina ha perdido 4 * 4 = 16 galones de agua.\n\n2. Si la piscina grande ahora tiene cuatro veces la cantidad de agua que la piscina pequeña, podemos establecer una ecuación. Supongamos que la cantidad de agua en la piscina pequeña ahora es \\(x\\) galones. Entonces, la cantidad de agua en la piscina grande ahora es \\(4x\\) galones.\n\n3. Hace 4 minutos, la piscina grande tenía \\(4x + 16\\) galones (ya que ha perdido 16 galones desde entonces) y la piscina pequeña tenía \\(x + 16\\) galones. Según el problema, estas cantidades eran iguales hace 4 minutos, por lo que podemos establecer la ecuación:\n\\[4x + 16 = x + 16\\]\n\n4. Resolviendo la ecuación:\n\\[4x + 16 = x + 16\\]\n\\[4x = x\\]\n\\[3x = 0\\]\n\nEsta ecuación parece incorrecta, lo que sugiere un error en la interpretación. Vamos a corregir la interpretación: la cantidad de agua que la piscina grande tenía hace 4 minutos (antes de perder 16 galones) era igual a la cantidad de agua que la piscina pequeña tiene ahora más 16 galones (la cantidad que la piscina pequeña ha perdido en 4 minutos). Entonces, la ecuación correcta es:\n\\[4x + 16 = x + 16 + 16\\]\n\\[4x + 16 = x + 32\\]\n\\[3x = 16\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{16}{3}\\]\n\nPor lo tanto, la piscina pequeña tiene ahora \\(\\frac{16}{3}\\) galones de agua, que es aproximadamente 5.33 galones."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "77a9a8233d94d9d18249e3fe691f2280e08edec6293c9dd28f7af15b86ed721a", "prompt_hash": "c411a8c19b73fc734d2670011386d4faa4b7f10270b2a6dc4d493c9340cdfdb9", "target_hash": "2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3", "exact_match": 0.0}

When the seagull landed, it swallowed half the number of chips Dave had eaten. Then, three pigeons intimidated it away from the food, and each pigeon ate three chips. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining chips. The ants carried away one last chip, leaving five. How many potato chips were in the bag that Dave bought?\"\n\nAhora, vamos a resolver el problema paso a paso:\n\n1. Las hormigas se llevaron una última patata, dejando cinco. Esto significa que antes de que las hormigas se llevaran la patata, quedaban 5 + 1 = 6 patatas.\n2. El mapache robó dos tercios de las patatas que quedaban, por lo que las 6 patatas que quedaban representan un tercio de las patatas que había antes de que el mapache interviniera. Por lo tanto, antes del robo del mapache, había 6 * 3 = 18 patatas.\n3. Las tres palomas comieron 3 patatas cada una, lo que suma 3 * 3 = 9 patatas. Entonces, antes de que las palomas comieran, había 18 + 9 = 27 patatas.\n4. La gaviota comió la mitad de las patatas que había comido Dave, es decir, 14 / 2 = 7 patatas. Entonces, antes de que la gaviota comiera, había 27 + 7 = 34 patatas.\n5.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had the same amount of water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times the amount of water in the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?\n\nAhora, vamos a resolver el problema paso a paso:\n\n1. Hace 4 minutos, la piscina grande tenía la misma cantidad de agua que la piscina pequeña. Dado que ambas piscinas están perdiendo agua a una tasa de 4 galones por minuto, en 4 minutos, cada piscina ha perdido 4 * 4 = 16 galones de agua.\n\n2. Si la piscina grande ahora tiene cuatro veces la cantidad de agua que la piscina pequeña, podemos establecer una ecuación. Supongamos que la cantidad de agua en la piscina pequeña ahora es \\(x\\) galones. Entonces, la cantidad de agua en la piscina grande ahora es \\(4x\\) galones.\n\n3. Hace 4 minutos, la piscina grande tenía \\(4x + 16\\) galones (ya que ha perdido 16 galones desde entonces) y la piscina pequeña tenía \\(x + 16\\) galones. Según el problema, estas cantidades eran iguales hace 4 minutos, por lo que podemos establecer la ecuación:\n\\[4x + 16 = x + 16\\]\n\n4. Resolviendo la ecuación:\n\\[4x + 16 = x + 16\\]\n\\[4x = x\\]\n\\[3x = 0\\]\n\nEsta ecuación parece incorrecta, lo que sugiere un error en la interpretación. Vamos a corregir la interpretación: la cantidad de agua que la piscina grande tenía hace 4 minutos (antes de perder 16 galones) era igual a la cantidad de agua que la piscina pequeña tiene ahora más 16 galones (la cantidad que la piscina pequeña ha perdido en 4 minutos). Entonces, la ecuación correcta es:\n\\[4x + 16 = x + 16 + 16\\]\n\\[4x + 16 = x + 32\\]\n\\[3x = 16\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{16}{3}\\]\n\nPor lo tanto, la piscina pequeña tiene ahora \\(\\frac{16}{3}\\) galones de agua, que es aproximadamente 5.33 galones."]], "filtered_resps": ["5.33"], "doc_hash": "77a9a8233d94d9d18249e3fe691f2280e08edec6293c9dd28f7af15b86ed721a", "prompt_hash": "c411a8c19b73fc734d2670011386d4faa4b7f10270b2a6dc4d493c9340cdfdb9", "target_hash": "2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3", "exact_match": 0.0}
