However, the question also asks how many girls are NOT in the scouts, which implies we need to know the number of boys and girls first.\n\nLet's assume the question means to ask for the number of girls not in the scouts, and we need to clarify the distribution of boys and girls first. Since the problem doesn't specify the number of boys and girls, we'll assume an equal distribution for simplicity, though this is not explicitly stated.\n\n1. If there are 200 students in total and we assume an equal number of boys and girls, then there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n2. 2/5 of the boys are in the scouts, so the number of boys in the scouts is 2/5 * 100 = 40 boys.\n3. 2/3 of the girls are in the scouts, so the number of girls in the scouts is 2/3 * 100 = 66.67, which we'll round to 67 girls (assuming we can't have a fraction of a person).\n4. Therefore, the number of girls not in the scouts is 100 - 67 = 33 girls.\n\nThe answer is 33 girls are not in the scouts, assuming an equal number of boys and girls and rounding the number of girls in scouts to the nearest whole number. However, the phrasing of the original question is unclear, and the distribution of boys and girls should be specified for a precise answer."]], "filtered_resps": ["33"], "doc_hash": "4fb96af85c217e243d089f55287ff21e3ce151ca4192e9e5bd944e2a8388e8fb", "prompt_hash": "9e213241f810786615fdf77114eaac75da07f204086cf847eb07662f95cba9ce", "target_hash": "d59eced1ded07f84c145592f65bdf854358e009c5cd705f5215bf18697fed103", "exact_match": 0.0}

However, based on the information given, we can focus on the ages to find the total age of the people mentioned, as there's no direct relation given between the ages of the people and the number of birds.\n\n1. Sally Thirty-Two's age is given as 8 years.\n2. Sally Four's age is the same as Sally Thirty-Two's, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.\n3. Granny Red's age is twice Sally Four's age, so Granny Red is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.\n4. Sally To's age is three years older than Granny Red's, so Sally To is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.\n\nNow, to find the total age of all the people mentioned:\n- Sally Thirty-Two: 8 years\n- Sally Four: 8 years\n- Granny Red: 16 years\n- Sally To: 19 years\n\nAdding these ages together: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years.\n\nThe question asks for the total age of the four people, not the birds. Therefore, the total age of the four people is 51 years.

According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \\( 4x \\).\n3. Sandra also ordered 200 lily callas, which is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we have the equation \\( 5x = 200 \\).\n\nFrom the equation \\( 5x = 200 \\), we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{200}{5} = 40 \\]\n\nSo, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is:\n\n\\[ 4x = 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 PM.

If both aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?\n\nLet's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \\(x\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the difference in the number of goldfish between the two aquariums is \\(32 - 4 = 28\\). This difference is also twice the number of fish in either aquarium, so we have:\n\\[28 = 2x\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[x = \\frac{28}{2} = 14\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

However, the question also asks how many girls are NOT in the scouts, which implies we need to know the number of boys and girls first.\n\nLet's assume the question means to ask for the number of girls not in the scouts, and we need to clarify the distribution of boys and girls first. Since the problem doesn't specify the number of boys and girls, we'll assume an equal distribution for simplicity, though this is not explicitly stated.\n\n1. If there are 200 students in total and we assume an equal number of boys and girls, then there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n2. 2/5 of the boys are in the scouts, so the number of boys in the scouts is 2/5 * 100 = 40 boys.\n3. 2/3 of the girls are in the scouts, so the number of girls in the scouts is 2/3 * 100 = 66.67, which we'll round to 67 girls (assuming we can't have a fraction of a person).\n4. Therefore, the number of girls not in the scouts is 100 - 67 = 33 girls.\n\nThe answer is 33 girls are not in the scouts, assuming an equal number of boys and girls and rounding the number of girls in scouts to the nearest whole number. However, the phrasing of the original question is unclear, and the distribution of boys and girls should be specified for a precise answer."]], "filtered_resps": ["33"], "doc_hash": "4fb96af85c217e243d089f55287ff21e3ce151ca4192e9e5bd944e2a8388e8fb", "prompt_hash": "9e213241f810786615fdf77114eaac75da07f204086cf847eb07662f95cba9ce", "target_hash": "d59eced1ded07f84c145592f65bdf854358e009c5cd705f5215bf18697fed103", "exact_match": 0.0}

However, based on the information given, we can focus on the ages to find the total age of the people mentioned, as there's no direct relation given between the ages of the people and the number of birds.\n\n1. Sally Thirty-Two's age is given as 8 years.\n2. Sally Four's age is the same as Sally Thirty-Two's, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.\n3. Granny Red's age is twice Sally Four's age, so Granny Red is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.\n4. Sally To's age is three years older than Granny Red's, so Sally To is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.\n\nNow, to find the total age of all the people mentioned:\n- Sally Thirty-Two: 8 years\n- Sally Four: 8 years\n- Granny Red: 16 years\n- Sally To: 19 years\n\nAdding these ages together: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years.\n\nThe question asks for the total age of the four people, not the birds.

According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \\( 4x \\).\n3. Sandra also ordered 200 lily callas, which is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we have the equation \\( 5x = 200 \\).\n\nFrom the equation \\( 5x = 200 \\), we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{200}{5} = 40 \\]\n\nSo, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is:\n\n\\[ 4x = 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 PM.

If both aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?\n\nLet's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \\(x\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the difference in the number of goldfish between the two aquariums is \\(32 - 4 = 28\\). This difference is also twice the number of fish in either aquarium, so we have:\n\\[28 = 2x\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[x = \\frac{28}{2} = 14\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.
