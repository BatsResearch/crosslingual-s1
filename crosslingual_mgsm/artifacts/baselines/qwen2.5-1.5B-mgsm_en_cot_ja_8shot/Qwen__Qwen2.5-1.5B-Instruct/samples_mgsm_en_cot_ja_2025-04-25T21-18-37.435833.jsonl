Let's denote the total number of cleaning machines as \\( T \\).\n2. According to the problem, 3/4 of the cleaning machines are sold at the green house, so \\( \\frac{3}{4}T \\) are sold.\n3. 2 cleaning machines are sold at the red house, so \\( 2 \\) are sold.\n4. The remaining cleaning machines are sold at the orange house, which is half of the remaining ones. Let's call the remaining number of cleaning machines \\( R \\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{2}R \\) are sold at the orange house.\n5. The total number of cleaning machines sold is \\( \\frac{3}{4}T + 2 + \\frac{1}{2}R \\).\n6. The remaining cleaning machines are 5, so \\( T - (\\frac{3}{4}T + 2 + \\frac{1}{2}R) = 5 \\).\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( T \\):\n\n\\( T - \\frac{3}{4}T - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}R = 5 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{4}T - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}R = 5 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{4}T = 7 + \\frac{1}{2}R \\)\n\n\\( T = 28 + 2R \\)\n\nSince we know that \\( R \\) is the remaining number of cleaning machines after selling at the green and red houses, and we know that \\( R \\) is half of the remaining ones, we can assume that \\( R \\) is a whole number. Let's try to find a value for \\( R \\) that makes sense.\n\nIf \\( R = 4 \\), then \\( T = 28 + 2(4) = 36 \\).\n\nSo, the total number of cleaning machines that were sold is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times

An ant ate the last 5 fried potatoes.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n(3/2) * ((x - 14) / 2 - 9) = 5\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n(3/2) * ((x - 14) / 2 - 9) = 5\n(x - 14) / 2 - 9 = 10/3\n(x - 14) / 2 = 10/3 + 9\n(x - 14) / 2 = 43/3\nx - 14 = 86/3\nx = 86/3 + 14\nx = 86/3 + 42/3\nx = 128/3\nx = 42.67\n\nSince the number of fried potatoes must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 43.\n\nSo, the package of fried potatoes had 43 fried potatoes in it."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "8d2cf626ae3007356ccc3b02695dc1c2edf6d87e142cdc8e7d907461108b1d3c", "prompt_hash": "cdf9722d1ea11caca423ef2449595b78594d0eef2710a585aacfc3bacb69dc82", "target_hash": "98010bd9270f9b100b6214a21754fd33bdc8d41b2bc9f9dd16ff54d3c34ffd71", "exact_match": 0.0}

This means the losing candidate received \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the votes.\n\nThe total number of votes cast is 80, which is the sum of the votes received by both candidates. So we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4}S + \\frac{1}{4}S = 80 \\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side gives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{4}S = 80 \\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[ S = 80 \\]\n\nSo, there are 80 students in the class. Now, to find out how many votes the losing candidate received, we calculate \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of 80:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 80 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the losing candidate received 20 votes."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "e0f570eecbf2bf1395bc51cfd1fd63a55c02d3a367721e56a48e4e640c71e511", "prompt_hash": "8d39545cb00c94d1418b2a710767da04f236cafff9048e7cb0b066ed01697dd4", "target_hash": "f5ca38f748a1d6eaf726b8a42fb575c3c71f1864a8143301782de13da2d9202b", "exact_match": 0.0}

Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S.\n2. According to the problem, S = 20.\n3. The problem states that Seattle has 4 times as many sheep as the number of sheep in Portland. So, if we let the number of sheep in Portland be P, then:\n   S = 4 * P\n4. Since S = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:\n   20 = 4 * P\n5. Solving for P, we get:\n   P = 20 / 4 = 5\n6. Now, we know that Portland has 5 sheep.\n7. The problem also states that Portland has 2 times as many sheep as the number of sheep in Charleston. So, if we let the number of sheep in Charleston be C, then:\n   P = 2 * C\n8. Since P = 5, we can substitute this into the equation:\n   5 = 2 * C\n9. Solving for C, we get:\n   C = 5 / 2 = 2.5\n10.

Let's denote the total number of cleaning machines as \\( T \\).\n2. According to the problem, 3/4 of the cleaning machines are sold at the green house, so \\( \\frac{3}{4}T \\) are sold.\n3. 2 cleaning machines are sold at the red house, so \\( 2 \\) are sold.\n4. The remaining cleaning machines are sold at the orange house, which is half of the remaining ones. Let's call the remaining number of cleaning machines \\( R \\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{2}R \\) are sold at the orange house.\n5. The total number of cleaning machines sold is \\( \\frac{3}{4}T + 2 + \\frac{1}{2}R \\).\n6. The remaining cleaning machines are 5, so \\( T - (\\frac{3}{4}T + 2 + \\frac{1}{2}R) = 5 \\).\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( T \\):\n\n\\( T - \\frac{3}{4}T - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}R = 5 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{4}T - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}R = 5 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{4}T = 7 + \\frac{1}{2}R \\)\n\n\\( T = 28 + 2R \\)\n\nSince we know that \\( R \\) is the remaining number of cleaning machines after selling at the green and red houses, and we know that \\( R \\) is half of the remaining ones, we can assume that \\( R \\) is a whole number. Let's try to find a value for \\( R \\) that makes sense.\n\nIf \\( R = 4 \\), then \\( T = 28 + 2(4) = 36 \\).\n\nSo, the total number of cleaning machines that were sold is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 36 + 2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 27 + 2 + 2 = 31 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of cleaning machines that were sold is 31, and the total number of cleaning machines that were sold is 31, so the
