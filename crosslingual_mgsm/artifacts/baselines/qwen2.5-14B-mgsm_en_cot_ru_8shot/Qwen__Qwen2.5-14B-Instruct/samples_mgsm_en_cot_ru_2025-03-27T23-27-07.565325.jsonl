Но когда я наливаю, то проливаю один литр апельсинового напитка. Сколько воды в оставшихся 24 литрах?\n\nШаг 1: Определим, сколько воды в 10 литрах апельсинового напитка. Поскольку напиток состоит на две трети из воды, то в 10 литрах воды будет 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 литра.\n\nШаг 2: Определим, сколько воды в 15 литрах ананасового напитка. Поскольку напиток состоит на три пятых из воды, то в 15 литрах воды будет 15 * (3/5) = 9 литров.\n\nШаг 3: Учитывая, что пролит один литр апельсинового напитка, в итоге осталось 9 литров апельсинового напитка. В 9 литрах апельсинового напитка воды будет 9 * (2/3) = 6 литров.\n\nШаг 4: Суммируем количество воды в оставшихся напитках.

Если он вытащит 30 комиксов, сколько игрушек ему нужно будет вытащить?\n\nШаг 1: Определим, сколько веса Юрайя уберет, вытащив 30 комиксов. Каждый комикс весит 1/4 фунта, поэтому 30 комиксов весят 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 фунтов.\n\nШаг 2: Определим, сколько веса еще нужно убрать. Юрайе нужно убрать в общей сложности 15 фунтов. Он уже убрал 7.5 фунтов, поэтому ему еще нужно убрать 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 фунтов.\n\nШаг 3: Определим, сколько игрушек нужно вытащить, чтобы убрать 7.5 фунтов.

Сколько составляет прибыль больницы от этих посещений?\"\n\nШаги решения:\n1. Сначала определим, сколько времени в минутах уходит на прием всех пациентов в день. Если каждый пациент проводит 24 минуты в больнице, то для 500 пациентов это будет 500 * 24 = 12000 минут.\n2. Переведем это время в часы: 12000 минут / 60 = 200 часов.\n3. Теперь определим, сколько денег больница получает от пациентов за эти 200 часов. Если пациенты платят 200 $ в час, то за 200 часов это будет 200 * 200 = 40000 $.\n4. Определим, сколько денег больница платит врачам за эти 200 часов. Если врачи берут 150 $ в час, то за 200 часов это будет 150 * 200 = 30000 $.\n5.

Каждый шоколадный батончик весит в два раза больше, чем каждое яблоко в карамели. Если каждый шоколадный батончик весит 40 г, сколько грамм весит мешок Джо с конфетами?\n\nШаги решения:\n1. Определим вес одного яблока в карамели. Если каждый шоколадный батончик весит 40 г и в два раза больше, чем яблоко в карамели, то каждое яблоко в карамели весит 40 / 2 = 20 г.\n2.

Определим общий вес всех яблок в карамели. 80 яблок в карамели по 20 г каждый дают 80 * 20 = 1600 г.\n4. Общий вес мешка с конфетами равен сумме веса всех шоколадных батончиков и всех яблок в карамели.

Прием каждого пациента длится в среднем 24 минуты. Доктора берут с больницы 150 $ в час, а больница берет с пациентов 200 $ в час. Сколько составляет прибыль больницы от этих посещений?\"\n\nШаги решения:\n1. Сначала определим, сколько времени в минутах уходит на прием всех пациентов в день. Если каждый пациент проводит 24 минуты в больнице, то для 500 пациентов это будет 500 * 24 = 12000 минут.\n2. Переведем это время в часы: 12000 минут / 60 = 200 часов.\n3. Теперь определим, сколько денег больница получает от пациентов за эти 200 часов. Если пациенты платят 200 $ в час, то за 200 часов это будет 200 * 200 = 40000 $.\n4. Определим, сколько денег больница платит врачам за эти 200 часов. Если врачи берут 150 $ в час, то за 200 часов это будет 150 * 200 = 30000 $.\n5. Прибыль больницы будет равна полученным от пациентов деньгам минус затраты на врачей: 40000 $ - 30000 $ = 10000 $.\n\nОтвет: Прибыль больницы от этих посещений составляет 10000 $ в день."]], "filtered_resps": ["10000"], "doc_hash": "d9ce461adecfbb68388c1237653b834f2d16c6d01050261fce891679195f6f66", "prompt_hash": "306f738bc2ebb4f6ef507e60858b1e4217ccdd89917350a57fa7eb1ac7f757a7", "target_hash": "39e5b4830d4d9c14db7368a95b65d5463ea3d09520373723430c03a5a453b5df", "exact_match": 1.0}

Это означает, что на каждый час, который она могла бы потратить на работу, она будет тратить дополнительно 55 $, если нанять бухгалтера.

The answer is 5.\n\nQuestion: Бринли учится в математическом классе мистера Берта. Мистер Берт проводит по шесть контрольных работ в каждом семестре. Он разрешает студентам убрать самую низкую оценку при расчете средней оценки за каждый семестр. Если за первые пять контрольных работ Бринли получила оценки 89, 71, 92, 100 и 86, какая оценка ей нужна за шестую контрольную работу, чтобы получить среднюю оценку 93?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["Для того чтобы Бринли получила среднюю оценку 93 по шести контрольным работам, сначала нужно учесть, что она может убрать самую низкую оценку из шести. Сначала посчитаем сумму оценок за первые пять контрольных работ: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. \n\nТеперь, чтобы получить среднюю оценку 93 по шести работам, общая сумма оценок должна быть 93 * 6 = 558. \n\nОднако, поскольку самую низкую оценку можно будет исключить, мы должны учесть, что эта самая низкая оценка (71) не будет включена в итоговую сумму для расчета средней оценки. Таким образом, нам нужно получить сумму 558 - 71 = 487, чтобы учесть исключение самой низкой оценки.\n\nТеперь, чтобы найти оценку, которую Бринли должна получить на шестой контрольной работе, нужно вычесть сумму оценок за первые пять работ (без самой низкой) из 487: 487 - (89 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 487 - 367 = 120.\n\nТаким образом, Бринли должна получить 120 баллов на шестой контрольной работе, чтобы иметь возможность исключить оценку 71 и получить среднюю оценку 93.
