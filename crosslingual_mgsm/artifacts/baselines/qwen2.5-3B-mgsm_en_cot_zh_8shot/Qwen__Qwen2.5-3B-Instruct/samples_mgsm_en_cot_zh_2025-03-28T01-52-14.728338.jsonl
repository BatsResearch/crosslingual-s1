The problem states that Alan has 5 more than half the number of jewelry pieces Raymond has. So, \\( A = \\frac{1}{2}R + 5 \\).\n3. Let \\( W \\) represent the number of jewelry pieces Xavien has. The problem states that Xavien has 2 fewer jewelry pieces than Alan. So, \\( W = A - 2 \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of jewelry pieces Alan has:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2}R + 5 = \\frac{1}{2}(40) + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of jewelry pieces Xavien has:\n\\[ W = A - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \\]\n\nTherefore, Xavien has 23 pieces of jewelry.

Since she rows 10 feet every time she encounters the leak, she encounters the leak 20 / 10 = 2 times while rowing 20 feet.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many times she encounters the leak in the remaining distance to the shore. The total distance to the shore is 64 seconds of rowing. Since she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, the total distance she rows in 64 seconds is (64 / 16) * 20 = 4 * 20 = 80 feet.\n\nSince she encounters the leak every 10 feet, she encounters the leak 80 / 10 = 8 times in the total distance of 80 feet.\n\nNow, we know that each time she encounters the leak, 2 liters of water enter the boat.

Since she rows 10 feet every time she encounters the leak, she encounters the leak 20 / 10 = 2 times while rowing 20 feet.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many times she encounters the leak in the remaining distance to the shore. The total distance to the shore is 64 seconds of rowing. Since she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, the total distance she rows in 64 seconds is (64 / 16) * 20 = 4 * 20 = 80 feet.\n\nSince she encounters the leak every 10 feet, she encounters the leak 80 / 10 = 8 times in the total distance of 80 feet.\n\nNow, we know that each time she encounters the leak, 2 liters of water enter the boat.
