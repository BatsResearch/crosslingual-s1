So, the total for the mice is \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\) stalks.\n- Each of the 10 cages of hamsters gets 5 stalks of hay. So, the total for the hamsters is \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\) stalks.\n- The cage of rabbits gets 20 stalks of hay.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of stalks of hay used is:\n\\[18 + 50 + 20 = 88\\]\n\nHowever, the problem states that 160 stalks of hay were used in total. This means there must be an additional 72 stalks used for the mice and hamsters, which we need to distribute among the cages.\n\nSince there are 3 cages for the mice, let's denote the number of mice in each cage as \\(x\\). Therefore, the total number of stalks used for the mice is:\n\\[3x \\times 6 = 18x\\]\n\nWe know that \\(18x = 88 + 72 = 160\\). Solving for \\(x\\):\n\\[18x = 160\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{160}{18} = \\frac{80}{9} \\approx 8.89\\]\n\nSince the number of mice must be a whole number, and the problem setup suggests an equal distribution, we need to recheck the total distribution. Given the total of 160 stalks and 3 cages for mice, the correct distribution per cage should be:\n\\[x = \\frac{160}{3 \\times 6} = \\frac{160}{18} = \\frac{80}{9} \\approx 8.89\\]\n\nSince the problem setup implies an equal distribution, and the closest whole number that fits the total is 8, we can conclude that each cage has 8 mice.\n\nThus, the number of mice in each cage is:\n\\[\\boxed{8}\\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "de4db4764c501c72f919c2ae856a07ef54efce51ef7ae802e655792838bb75db", "prompt_hash": "745450549f1d05fc3132295af50158c88cf0638a915cd77cb4e46398c05c791f", "target_hash": "ef2d127de37b942baad06145e54b0c619a1f22327b2ebbcfbec78f5564afe39d", "exact_match": 0.0}

Now, the large pool has four times the amount of water as the small pool:\n\\[ L - 16 - 16 = 4(S - 16) \\]\n\\[ L - 32 = 4S - 64 \\]\n\\[ L = 4S - 32 \\]\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( L - 16 = 2(S - 16) \\)\n2. \\( L = 4S - 32 \\)\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( L \\):\n\\[ L - 16 = 2S - 32 \\]\n\\[ L = 2S - 16 \\]\n\nNow we have two expressions for \\( L \\):\n\\[ L = 2S - 16 \\]\n\\[ L = 4S - 32 \\]\n\nSet these two expressions equal to each other:\n\\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 32 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( S \\):\n\\[ 32 - 16 = 4S - 2S \\]\n\\[ 16 = 2S \\]\n\\[ S = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the initial amount of water in the small water pool is 8 gallons.\n\nNow, we can find the initial amount of water in the large water pool using \\( L = 4S - 32 \\):\n\\[ L = 4(8) - 32 \\]\n\\[ L = 32 - 32 \\]\n\\[ L = 0 \\]\n\nSince the large pool was initially empty, the amount of water in the large pool now is:\n\\[ L - 16 - 16 = 0 - 32 = -32 \\]\n\nHowever, this result doesn't make sense in the context of water volume. Let's re-evaluate the problem:\n\nGiven the conditions, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's recheck the setup:\n\nIf 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice the amount of water as the small pool, and now the large pool has four times the amount of water as the small pool, we need to consider the initial conditions more carefully.\n\nLet's denote the initial amounts as \\( L_0 \\) and \\( S_0 \\) for the large and small pools respectively. The equations should be:\n\\[ L_0 - 16 = 2(S_0 - 16) \\]\n\\[ L_0 - 32 = 4(S_0 - 16) \\]\n\nSolving these:\n\\[ L_0 - 16 = 2S_0 - 32 \\]\n\\[ L_0 = 2S_0 - 16 \\]\n\nAnd:\n\\[ L_0 - 32 = 4S_0 - 64 \\]\n\\[ L_0 = 4S_0 - 32 \\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\( L_0 \\):\n\\[ 2S_0 - 16 = 4S_0 - 32 \\]\n\\[ 16 = 2S_0 \\]\n\\[ S_0 = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the initial amount of water in the small pool is 8 gallons. Now, the amount of water in the large pool now is:\n\\[ L_0 - 32 = 4S_0 - 32 = 4(8) - 32 = 32 - 32 = 0 \\]\n\nThus, the small pool now has:\n\\[ S - 16 = 8 - 16 = -8 \\]\n\nThis still doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and conditions. Given the conditions, it seems there might be an error in the problem setup. \n\nGiven the conditions, the correct interpretation should be:\n- Initial small pool: 8 gallons\n- Initial large pool: 16 gallons (since 4 minutes ago it was twice the small pool)\n\nNow, the small pool has:\n\\[ 8 - 16 = -8 \\]\n\nThis indicates an error in the problem setup. The correct answer should be re-evaluated based on the given conditions. \n\nGiven the conditions, the correct answer should be:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]\n\nThis is the amount of water in the small pool now, considering the initial conditions and the problem setup."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "doc_hash": "b56427db6acd545a23fbaa5bb4e07bd29bf8bfd8363f35d892eba1851e910ded", "prompt_hash": "efc5cd7b393b7f619d39526e48c040a3573f7a8d87c613f9b77834adbb0132d9", "target_hash": "2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3", "exact_match": 0.0}

However, we don't know the original price, but we know that the price increased by 50%. This means the current price is 150% of the original price.\n\nTo find the original price, we need to determine the current price per piece of wood.

So, the total for the mice is \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\) stalks.\n- Each of the 10 cages of hamsters gets 5 stalks of hay. So, the total for the hamsters is \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\) stalks.\n- The cage of rabbits gets 20 stalks of hay.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of stalks of hay used is:\n\\[18 + 50 + 20 = 88\\]\n\nHowever, the problem states that 160 stalks of hay were used in total. This means there must be an additional 72 stalks used for the mice and hamsters, which we need to distribute among the cages.\n\nSince there are 3 cages for the mice, let's denote the number of mice in each cage as \\(x\\). Therefore, the total number of stalks used for the mice is:\n\\[3x \\times 6 = 18x\\]\n\nWe know that \\(18x = 88 + 72 = 160\\). Solving for \\(x\\):\n\\[18x = 160\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{160}{18} = \\frac{80}{9} \\approx 8.89\\]\n\nSince the number of mice must be a whole number, and the problem setup suggests an equal distribution, we need to recheck the total distribution. Given the total of 160 stalks and 3 cages for mice, the correct distribution per cage should be:\n\\[x = \\frac{160}{3 \\times 6} = \\frac{160}{18} = \\frac{80}{9} \\approx 8.89\\]\n\nSince the problem setup implies an equal distribution, and the closest whole number that fits the total is 8, we can conclude that each cage has 8 mice.\n\nThus, the number of mice in each cage is:\n\\[\\boxed{8}\\]"]], "filtered_resps": ["8"], "doc_hash": "de4db4764c501c72f919c2ae856a07ef54efce51ef7ae802e655792838bb75db", "prompt_hash": "745450549f1d05fc3132295af50158c88cf0638a915cd77cb4e46398c05c791f", "target_hash": "ef2d127de37b942baad06145e54b0c619a1f22327b2ebbcfbec78f5564afe39d", "exact_match": 0.0}

Now, the large pool has four times the amount of water as the small pool:\n\\[ L - 16 - 16 = 4(S - 16) \\]\n\\[ L - 32 = 4S - 64 \\]\n\\[ L = 4S - 32 \\]\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( L - 16 = 2(S - 16) \\)\n2. \\( L = 4S - 32 \\)\n\nLet's solve the first equation for \\( L \\):\n\\[ L - 16 = 2S - 32 \\]\n\\[ L = 2S - 16 \\]\n\nNow we have two expressions for \\( L \\):\n\\[ L = 2S - 16 \\]\n\\[ L = 4S - 32 \\]\n\nSet these two expressions equal to each other:\n\\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 32 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( S \\):\n\\[ 32 - 16 = 4S - 2S \\]\n\\[ 16 = 2S \\]\n\\[ S = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the initial amount of water in the small water pool is 8 gallons.\n\nNow, we can find the initial amount of water in the large water pool using \\( L = 4S - 32 \\):\n\\[ L = 4(8) - 32 \\]\n\\[ L = 32 - 32 \\]\n\\[ L = 0 \\]\n\nSince the large pool was initially empty, the amount of water in the large pool now is:\n\\[ L - 16 - 16 = 0 - 32 = -32 \\]\n\nHowever, this result doesn't make sense in the context of water volume. Let's re-evaluate the problem:\n\nGiven the conditions, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's recheck the setup:\n\nIf 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice the amount of water as the small pool, and now the large pool has four times the amount of water as the small pool, we need to consider the initial conditions more carefully.\n\nLet's denote the initial amounts as \\( L_0 \\) and \\( S_0 \\) for the large and small pools respectively. The equations should be:\n\\[ L_0 - 16 = 2(S_0 - 16) \\]\n\\[ L_0 - 32 = 4(S_0 - 16) \\]\n\nSolving these:\n\\[ L_0 - 16 = 2S_0 - 32 \\]\n\\[ L_0 = 2S_0 - 16 \\]\n\nAnd:\n\\[ L_0 - 32 = 4S_0 - 64 \\]\n\\[ L_0 = 4S_0 - 32 \\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\( L_0 \\):\n\\[ 2S_0 - 16 = 4S_0 - 32 \\]\n\\[ 16 = 2S_0 \\]\n\\[ S_0 = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the initial amount of water in the small pool is 8 gallons. Now, the amount of water in the large pool now is:\n\\[ L_0 - 32 = 4S_0 - 32 = 4(8) - 32 = 32 - 32 = 0 \\]\n\nThus, the small pool now has:\n\\[ S - 16 = 8 - 16 = -8 \\]\n\nThis still doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and conditions. Given the conditions, it seems there might be an error in the problem setup. \n\nGiven the conditions, the correct interpretation should be:\n- Initial small pool: 8 gallons\n- Initial large pool: 16 gallons (since 4 minutes ago it was twice the small pool)\n\nNow, the small pool has:\n\\[ 8 - 16 = -8 \\]\n\nThis indicates an error in the problem setup. The correct answer should be re-evaluated based on the given conditions. \n\nGiven the conditions, the correct answer should be:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]\n\nThis is the amount of water in the small pool now, considering the initial conditions and the problem setup."]], "filtered_resps": ["8"], "doc_hash": "b56427db6acd545a23fbaa5bb4e07bd29bf8bfd8363f35d892eba1851e910ded", "prompt_hash": "efc5cd7b393b7f619d39526e48c040a3573f7a8d87c613f9b77834adbb0132d9", "target_hash": "2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3", "exact_match": 1.0}
