In one hour of running, she can cover 3 miles.\n4. In two hours of walking, she can cover 0.75 miles per hour * 2 hours = 1.5 miles.\n5. In six hours, if she uses one hour for running and two hours for walking, she will have three hours left for either walking or running. However, the question specifies only one hour for running and two for walking, so we'll use the given time distribution.\n6. Therefore, in six hours, she can travel 3 miles (from running) + 1.5 miles (from walking) = 4.5 miles.\n\nThe answer is 4.5 miles."]], "filtered_resps": ["4.5"], "doc_hash": "c659081b7e2cd7c7ce0f7ea2684edb4653db7239f51d5038239e5b25dd14cc7d", "prompt_hash": "cfd53c390e4aa52135a877d95ed13ffbe466a01a32a366d3f0e3a92de451f84c", "target_hash": "4ec9599fc203d176a301536c2e091a19bc852759b255bd6818810a42c5fed14a", "exact_match": 0.0}

The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls, which is 60 + 120 = 180 students.\n4. The question states there are 5 teachers per student, which seems to be a mistake because it would imply an extremely high number of teachers. Assuming it means there are 5 teachers for all the students, the school has 5 teachers.\n\nThe answer is 5 teachers."]], "filtered_resps": ["5"], "doc_hash": "991f7b438326ab1df253e24729af35d334d855584df56f2b0850fe5f216e1b9e", "prompt_hash": "b58164f131db5552a4a6c05e663040f68356128285ca38afa7027ceef1efa0ac", "target_hash": "76a50887d8f1c2e9301755428990ad81479ee21c25b43215cf524541e0503269", "exact_match": 0.0}

If their salaries increased proportionally, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so the increase is 30,769.23 * 0.40 = $12,307.69 (approximately).\n6.

Two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jean's age. If Jean is 30 years old, how old is Mark?\"\n\nNow, let's solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Jean is 30 years old.\n2. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Mark is 30 - 2 = 28 years old.\n3. To verify, let's check the second condition: two years ago, Mark was 28 - 2 = 26 years old.\n4. Two years ago, Jean was 30 - 2 = 28 years old, and half of Jean's age at that time would be 28 / 2 = 14 years.\n5. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jean's age, which is 14 + 5 = 19 years. However, we calculated that two years ago, Mark was 26 years old, which does not match the condition given in the problem. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem statement.\n\nGiven the problem's conditions and the direct relationship between Jean and Mark's ages, the straightforward answer based on the first condition is that Mark is 28 years old. The second condition seems to be a verification step that does not align with the direct age difference given.

The black chickens lay 3 eggs per day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than black chickens, how many black chickens does he have?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Answer:\n1. Let's denote the number of black chickens as B and the number of white chickens as W.\n2. According to the problem, W = B + 2.\n3. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, which is the sum of the eggs laid by the black and white chickens.\n4. The black chickens lay 3 eggs each per day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each per day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3B + 5W = 42.\n5. Substitute W = B + 2 into the equation: 3B + 5(B + 2) = 42.\n6. Simplify the equation: 3B + 5B + 10 = 42.\n7. Combine like terms: 8B + 10 = 42.\n8. Subtract 10 from both sides: 8B = 32.\n9.

In one hour of running, she can cover 3 miles.\n4. In two hours of walking, she can cover 0.75 miles per hour * 2 hours = 1.5 miles.\n5. In six hours, if she uses one hour for running and two hours for walking, she will have three hours left for either walking or running.

How much water did these shoes leak by the time Julia reached the shore?\"\n\nNow, let's solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determine the speed of walking:** Julia walks 20 feet in 16 seconds.

Miaka minne baadaye, mshahara wake ulikuwa umeongezeka, na alikuwa anapata 40% zaidi ya mshahara ambao alikuwa anapata miaka minne iliyopita. Ikiwa mshahara wa Adrien na Lylah uliongeleza sambamba, na Adrien alikuwa anapata $40000 miaka minne iliyopita, piga hesabu ya jumla ya mshahara ambao watu hao wawili walikuwa wanapokea miaka minne baadaye?\nStep-by-Step Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "until": ["</s>", "<|im_end|>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768, "temperature": 0}}}, "resps": [["First, let's translate the question into English: \"Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Four years later, his salary increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was earning four years ago. If their salaries increased proportionally, and Adrien was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total salary that these two people were earning four years later.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Answer:\n1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.\n2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later, so the increase is 40,000 * 0.40 = $16,000.\n3. Adrien's new salary is 40,000 + 16,000 = $56,000.\n4. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, Lylah's salary was 40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).\n5. If their salaries increased proportionally, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so the increase is 30,769.23 * 0.40 = $12,307.69 (approximately).\n6. Lylah's new salary is 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = $43,076.92 (approximately).\n7. The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were earning four years later is 56,000 + 43,076.92 = $99,076.92 (approximately).\n\nThe answer is approximately $99,076.92."]], "filtered_resps": ["$99,076.92."], "doc_hash": "b6683f16e3e3c561fe3afeca8b882a0e91af721dffde86757f2bab72be38dcc2", "prompt_hash": "e625fb33e123a598b93d2268993de66eca33811bf054012d68cb77ed42c1dc77", "target_hash": "c3dd3155bfb41ce88db8cb3949533694746fe2767aeea3faba904b50baabfca6", "exact_match": 0.0}

She already has 3 clients, but she is talking to 5 more and is confident that she will add them to her calculations. Each client's house will require 2 bottles of chlorine and one replacement of cleaning cloths. The bottles of chlorine cost $2 each and the replacements of cleaning cloths cost $5 each. These are her only operational costs. She calculates that her total expenses per week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total operational costs, so what profit, in dollars, will Kim make per week?\"\n\nNow, let's solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:**\n   - She already has 3 clients.\n   - She is confident she will add 5 more.\n   - Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.\n\n2. **Calculate the operational costs per client:**\n   - Each client requires 2 bottles of chlorine at $2 each.\n   - Each client requires 1 replacement of cleaning cloths at $5 each.\n   - Cost per client = (2 bottles * $2) + $5 = $4 + $5 = $9.\n\n3. **Calculate the total operational costs for all clients:**\n   - Total clients = 8.\n   - Total operational costs = 8 clients * $9 per client = $72.\n\n4. **Determine the total income Kim expects:**\n   - Kim calculates that her total expenses per week will be $92.\n   - This implies that her total income is $92 (since the operational costs are part of the income calculation).\n\n5. **Calculate the profit:**\n   - Profit = Total income - Total operational costs.\n   - Profit = $92 - $72 = $20.\n\nTherefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 per week."]], "filtered_resps": ["$20"], "doc_hash": "1d7ac3238423923b03909cdea7d6eafacaa40d45bc906c52e892e1b70cf845c1", "prompt_hash": "6129d9e790f6850fc8a9a21ed295975178b0d64f092052d837112bc68123f642", "target_hash": "f5ca38f748a1d6eaf726b8a42fb575c3c71f1864a8143301782de13da2d9202b", "exact_match": 1.0}

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, which is the sum of the eggs laid by the black and white chickens.\n4. The black chickens lay 3 eggs each per day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each per day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3B + 5W = 42.\n5. Substitute W = B + 2 into the equation: 3B + 5(B + 2) = 42.\n6. Simplify the equation: 3B + 5B + 10 = 42.\n7. Combine like terms: 8B + 10 = 42.\n8. Subtract 10 from both sides: 8B = 32.\n9.

Naomi scored 68 points of those. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points, and Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score?\"\n\nNow, let's solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Naomi scored 68 points.\n2. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.\n3. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.\n4. The total points scored by the four students is 251. We know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna, so we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the sum of the other three students' points from the total.\n\nSo, Jojo's points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points)\nJojo's points = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85)\nJojo's points = 251 - 197\nJojo's points = 54\n\nThe answer is Jojo scored 54 points."]], "filtered_resps": ["54"], "doc_hash": "5e87f127bc475ba1c462a0bd945e01e075f3998ca03105996453d228e83f808c", "prompt_hash": "4648af680767409cc46b01e930af8ed5f981f615ee11dc04e09c46e9912a6760", "target_hash": "2fca346db656187102ce806ac732e06a62df0dbb2829e511a770556d398e1a6e", "exact_match": 1.0}
