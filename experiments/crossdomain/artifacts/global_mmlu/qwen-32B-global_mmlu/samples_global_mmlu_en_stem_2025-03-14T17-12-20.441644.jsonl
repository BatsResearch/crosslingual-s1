The magnetic force on a moving charge is given by \\( \\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\), where \\( q \\) is the charge of the proton, \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is the velocity of the proton, and \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) is the magnetic field.\n\n2. **Proton's Direction of Motion:** Given that the proton enters the solenoid moving along the axis of the solenoid, the velocity of the proton \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field \\( \\mathbf{B} \\).\n\n3. **Effect of the Magnetic Field:** The force acting on a charge moving perpendicular to the magnetic field would cause the charge to move in a circular path if only magnetic force is considered. However, when the velocity vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is parallel to the magnetic field \\( \\mathbf{B} \\), the magnetic force \\( \\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\) becomes zero because the cross product of parallel vectors is zero. Thus, there is no force acting on the proton to alter its direction or speed.\n\nGiven these points, we conclude:\n- There is no bending force acting on the proton since there is no magnetic force perpendicular to its velocity.\n- Hence, the proton will continue moving in a straight line along the axis of the solenoid.\n\nOption C accurately describes this behavior: \"The proton will continue in its straight path at constant velocity.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.

Therefore, we need to adjust the mean (μ) such that \\( P(X > 12) \\leq 0.01 \\), where \\( X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\).\n\nTo convert this into a z-score problem, we use the formula:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWe want \\( P(X > 12) \\) to be at most 0.01. In terms of the standard normal distribution, we need \\( P(Z > z) \\leq 0.01 \\).\n\nFrom standard normal distribution tables or z-tables, the z-value corresponding to \\( P(Z > z) = 0.01 \\) is approximately 2.326 (this means \\( Z \\leq 2.326 \\) covers 99%).\n\nThus, \\( Z = 2.326 \\) corresponds to the 99th percentile. For \\( X \\) to be 12 oz at this percentile:\n\\[ 2.326 = \\frac{12 - \\mu}{0.3} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\mu\\):\n\\[ 2.326 = \\frac{12 - \\mu}{0.3} \\]\n\\[ 12 - \\mu = 2.326 \\times 0.3 \\]\n\\[ 12 - \\mu = 0.6978 \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 12 - 0.6978 \\]\n\\[ \\mu \\approx 11.3022 \\]\n\nNow looking at the options given:\n- A. 12 - 0.99(0.3) ounces (which is 11.703 ounces)\n- B. 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces (which is 11.3022 ounces)\n- C. 12 - 2.576(0.3) ounces (which is 11.1268 ounces)\n- D. 12 + 2.326(0.3) ounces (which is 12.6978 ounces)\n\nThe correct setting so that the cup will overflow less than 1% of the time is:\n\\[ \\boxed{B. 12 - 2.326(0.3) \\text{ ounces}} \\]"], "doc_hash": "153a16d9b45a5f23821b43e1fdf64cdb3735ec172590f15aa98a08243f82436c", "prompt_hash": "89411effd28b74d133ef81bba48ad0165ffcab9d31d948a4ce18d16900f68839", "target_hash": "df7e70e5021544f4834bbee64a9e3789febc4be81470df629cad6ddb03320a5c", "exact_match": 0.0}
