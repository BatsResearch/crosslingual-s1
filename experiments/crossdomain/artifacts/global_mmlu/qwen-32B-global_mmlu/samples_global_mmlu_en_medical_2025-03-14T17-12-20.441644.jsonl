The WTO’s agreements aim to create certainty and predictability in international agricultural trade, although the effects can be complex and not always favor developing countries.\n  \n- **C.** Although supermarkets have certainly become a significant part of the global food market, this option oversimplifies the extent of globalisation in food and agriculture. Globalisation affects every aspect of the food supply chain, from production and processing to distribution and consumption, impacting a broad range of actors from small farmers to multinational corporations.\n  \n- **D.** While publicly-owned food reserves can be a tool for managing food security, this statement is not accurate in describing how globalisation affects food security for developing countries. The major challenge lies in the unfair trade practices facilitated by wealthy nations’ practices and policies rather than in what developing countries have to do unilaterally.\n\nTherefore, option A accurately identifies a key issue regarding the impact of globalisation on food security, pointing out the barriers created by wealthy nations that hinder the potential benefits for developing countries."], "doc_hash": "b297b9fbeb3f2d2a690dd641e6fd2f8e1df8677b819638ed97ee61c28c5aa6b1", "prompt_hash": "448ea78db8a53edfe9531439a258d4e694827ad37c0053b5468b2c59ebca7865", "target_hash": "559aead08264d5795d3909718cdd05abd49572e84fe55590eef31a88a08fdffd", "exact_match": 0.0}
