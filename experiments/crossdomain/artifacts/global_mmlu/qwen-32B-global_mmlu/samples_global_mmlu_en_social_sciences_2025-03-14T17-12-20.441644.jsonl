This leads to a leftward shift in the demand curve.\n\n2. **Fall in the Price of Inputs (Seed Corn and Fertilizer)**: These reductions lower the cost of production for corn, encouraging producers to supply more corn at each price level. This leads to a rightward shift in the supply curve.\n\nGiven these two shifts, the effects on equilibrium quantity and price are as follows:\n\n- **Equilibrium Quantity**: The decrease in demand (leftward shift) would tend to reduce equilibrium quantity, while the increase in supply (rightward shift) would tend to increase it. The net effect on quantity is therefore indeterminate, as it depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts in demand and supply.\n  \n- **Equilibrium Price**: The decrease in demand would tend to lower equilibrium price, whereas the increase in supply would also push the equilibrium price lower. Both shifts work in the same direction with respect to price. Therefore, the equilibrium price is likely to fall.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB.

The successes of the past policy initiatives in the post-9/11 community have reinforced the trend toward coercive diplomacy by increasing American political will to counter mass casualty terrorism in failing states.\nB. The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states.\nC. The demise of the ideological bipolar division of international society in the Cold War, rather than resulting in a reduction of hostilities, has left an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a very real threat. Risk of uncontrollable escalation still remains but in a different form; mass casualty terrorism, contagion from failing states and non-state actors seeking to acquire WMD are the primary concern of states and require responses in the form of military intervention.\nD. The hostile geopolitical environment has encouraged states to pursue military strategies in order to secure their interests. The use of violence rather than diplomacy or incentives has become the primary response to threats, whether these are posed by other states, resource scarcity, pandemic diseases, or other non-traditional threats.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": {"until": ["</s>"], "max_gen_toks": 32768}}}, "resps": [["The correct answer among the options provided is **B**.
